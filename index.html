class="intro-text">The Digital Humanities Research Institute (DHRI) is an intensive, community-oriented,  and foundational approach to learning technical skills in service of humanities teaching and  learning. The DHRI curriculum features workshops, tutorials, glossaries, resources, reading  materials, and more that have been developed at The Graduate Center, City University of New York  since 2016. Part of a 2019 grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities&#x27; (NEH) Office of  Digital Humanities (ODH), DHRI&#x27;s curriculum, which was originally developed for in-person workshops,  was revised in Summer 2020 to better meet the needs of virtual instruction due to the covid-19 pandemic.  While the curriculum has always been available openly on GitHub, this site creates a more  user-friendly and functional interface that is open and free for public use.</p></p></div><div

became popular in the 1990s. It was used primarily for desktop applications, but as the web became a bigger deal, Java was positioned as the language of choice for web development.\n\n\u003cCodeEditor language='JavaScript'\u003e\n1 + 1\n\u003c/CodeEditor\u003e\n\n## What am I doing here?\n\nYou the reader may have come to this page pre-convinced that you want to learn how to program. To the wholly unconvinced, I can only ask, \"Why are you taking this class?\" The majority, including myself at first, exist in a state between the two. I am not going to try to convince you of the 'value' of programming, as value is a personal question. Instead I will show you a few neat tools that  \n\n## Cool, inspiring libraries\n\nWhat's possible with JavaScript? JavaScript is a programming language that can be used to create dynamic web pages. It can be used to create interactive web applications, or to create data visualizations and animations. Here are some cool libraries that you can use with JavaScript.\n\n- [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/)\n- [D3.js](https://d3js.org/)\n- [p5.js](https://p5js.org/)\n- [leaflet.js](https://leafletjs.com/)\n\n# Getting Started with JavaScript\n\nLet's begin our journey with the JavaScript language. As is tradition, we're first going to explore some ways to print a \"Hello World!\" message as output to the screen. In doing so, you will be introduced to the basics of working with the JavaScript console. As will become clearer, you can think of the console as an interactive way to run basic JavaScript commands in your browser. \n\nTo become further acquainted with the console, we will end the lesson by exploring basic data types and variables in JavaScript, and how you can use these capabilities to calculate and display a variety of conditions.\n\n## Hello, World!\n\n### Alerts\n\nOne of the most basic ways to output a message is to use the `alert()` method. This method will display a message to the user visiting your web page, and then wait for the user to click on the \"OK\" button.\n\nTo create an alert, you can write the following line of code...\n\n```JavaScript\nalert(\"Hello, World!\");\n```\n\n...into the box below, where you can see an instance of the interactive console that we have provided for you. If you click your mouse after the `\u003e` symbol (called the _prompt_), you can begin writing your code, and then hit the \u003ckbd\u003eEnter\u003c/kbd\u003e key to run it.\n\n\u003cJSTerminal /\u003e\n\nYou should now see a pop-up box that displays your message. __Note__: If you do _not_ see a pop-up message, you may need to disable your pop-up blocker.\n\nAs you can see, the alert dialog box takes the focus and forces the user to read the specified message on the current webpage. This being the case, it is wise to avoid overusing this method because it stops the user from accessing other parts of the webpage until the box is closed. It is best used as a kind of warning message. For instance, you may have seen developers use it to notify the user that they are heading to a new external website after clicking a link.\n\nYou'll notice that our message is enclosed in `()` (parentheses) as well as `\"\"` double quotations marks. You'll understand why as we continue: this indicates part of the _syntax_, or the rules that define the structure of the JavaScript language.\n\nYou will also notice that there is a `;`(semicolon) after the `alert` command. Not including the semicolon won't throw an error, but it is good practice to include after each command, or statement--after each single instruction given to the console. You'll see more examples of this (and learn when _not_ to include semicolons) as we progress. For now, make sure to __include the semicolon__ at the end of each line of code.\n\n### Using Your Browser's Console\n\nWhile we have provided a console for you embedded into this web page, you can also use the console to run commands directly from your browser's developer tools. Most modern browsers allow you access to a developer console where you can work with JavaScript and read or manipulate data on a page. \n\nTo open the developer console, you can use these methods:\n\n__Chrome:__\n- Command + Option + i (Mac)\n- Ctrl + Shift + i (Windows/Linux).\n- Open the Chrome settings menu in the top-right corner of your browser window and select `More Tools` \u003e `Developer Tools`\n\n__Firefox:__\n- Command + Option + i (Mac)\n- Ctrl + Shift + i (Windows/Linux)\n\n__Safari:__\n- Develop menu in Safari’s Advanced preferences\n- Right-click on any page element and select Inspect Element\n- Command + Option + i\n\n__Opera:__\n- Command + Option + i (Mac)\n- Ctrl + Shift + i (Windows/Linux)\n\nUsing these shortcuts should open a console window that you can use to run commands. After the `\u003e` prompt, create another new `alert` command and hit the \u003ckbd\u003eEnter\u003c/kbd\u003e key to run it. You should again see a pop-up box that displays your message.\n\nWe should note here that the alert's system dialog box is not related to the design of the webpage currently being shown in the browser. Its appearance depends solely on your current operating system and browser (rather than on the HTML code of the current page). You will learn how to manipulate a webpage's content and appearance directly with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS in later lessons.  \n\n### The console.log() Function\n\nLet's use another technique to display \"Hello, World!\" This time, we will use the `console.log()` function, which writes a message to the console. In your browser's developer console, write the following line of code:\n\n```JavaScript\nconsole.log(\"Hello, World!\");\n```\n\nYou should see the message \"Hello, World!\" now printed out for you in the console itself.\n\nThe `console.log()` function is a useful tool for testing and debugging your code. As you continue learning JavaScript and begin building your own webpages, you will find it an effective way to display and understand the results of your programs.\n\n__Note__: If you also receive a message of `undefined` in the console, don't worry! You will understand why this is happening as you continue learning more about how functions work in JavaScript.\n\nFor now, let's continue working with the JavaScript console by exploring the way the language deals with data and discrete bits of information.\n\n## Data Types\n\n__Data types__ form the atomic elements of JavaScript programs and are used to store and manipulate data. The basic data types in JavaScript are: __number__, __string__, __boolean__, __array__, and __object__. For now, let's just discuss the first three of these types and how you can use them.\n\n### Numbers\n\nValues of the `number` type are, as you might have guessed, numbers. Try typing the following numbers into the console, hitting the \u003ckbd\u003eEnter\u003c/kbd\u003e key after each one:\n\n```JavaScript\n\u003e 9;\n\u003e 3.8;\n\u003e -1.2;\n```\n\u003cJSTerminal /\u003e\n\nAs you can see, JavaScript recognizes a variety of different number categories. Unlike other programming languages you may (or may not) be familiar with, JavaScript does not define different types of numbers, like integer, double, etc. All numbers are recognized as the same type.\n\nWe can also perform various mathematical calculations on these numbers. For example, try running each of the following mathematical operations in the console:\n\n```JavaScript\n\u003e 5 + 5\n\u003e 5 - 5\n\u003e 5 / 5\n\u003e 5 * 5\n\u003e 5 % 6\n```\n\n\u003cJSTerminal /\u003e\n\nJavaScript effectively calculates the result of these operations for you. Whenever you can use a number, you can also create a mathematical expression using typical algebraic operators. The last example (in case you are unfamiliar) uses the \u003ckbd\u003e%\u003c/kbd\u003e (remainder) symbol, which evaluates the remainder of a division.  \n\nIn the table below, you can see more of the various operators available to you as a JS programmer when working with data types. Many of the most useful operators deal in terms of comparison:  seeing if one value is equal to, greater than, or lesser than another value. Each of these comparisons will evaluate to either true or false. It is important to understand how these operators work, so try inputting some of the examples you might be unclear with into the JS console to check out the results for yourself.\n\n\u003ctable\u003e\n    \u003ccaption\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eComparison Operators\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/caption\u003e\n    \u003ctr\u003e\n        \u003cth\u003eOperator\u003c/th\u003e\n        \u003cth\u003eMeaning\u003c/th\u003e\n        \u003cth\u003eExample\u003c/th\u003e\n        \u003cth\u003eEvaluation\u003c/th\u003e\n    \u003c/tr\u003e\n    \u003ctr\u003e\n        \u003cth rowspan = \"2\"\u003e \u003c \u003c/th\u003e\n        \u003ctd\u003e less than? \u003c/td\u003e\n        \u003ctd\u003e 5 \u003c 5 \u003c/td\u003e\n        \u003ctd\u003efalse\u003c/td\u003e\n    \u003c/tr\u003e\n   \u003ctr\u003e\n        \u003ctd\u003e less than? \u003c/td\u003e\n        \u003ctd\u003e 5 \u003c 6 \u003c/td\u003e\n        \u003ctd\u003etrue\u003c/td\u003e\n    \u003c/tr\u003e\n    \u003ctr\u003e\n        \u003cth rowspan = \"2\"\u003e \u003e \u003c/th\u003e\n        \u003ctd\u003e greater than? \u003c/td\u003e\n        \u003ctd\u003e 5 \u003e 5 \u003c/td\u003e\n        \u003ctd\u003efalse\u003c/td\u003e\n    \u003c/tr\u003e\n    \u003ctr\u003e\n        \u003ctd\u003e greater than? \u003c/td\u003e\n        \u003ctd\u003e 5 \u003e 4 \u003c/td\u003e\n        \u003ctd\u003etrue\u003c/td\u003e\n    \u003c/tr\u003e\n    \u003ctr\u003e\n        \u003cth rowspan = \"2\"\u003e\u003c=\u003c/th\u003e\n        \u003ctd\u003e less than or equal to? \u003c/td\u003e\n        \u003ctd\u003e 5 \u003c= 5 \u003c/td\u003e\n        \u003ctd\u003etrue\u003c/td\u003e\n    \u003c/tr\u003e\n    \u003ctr\u003e\n        \u003ctd\u003e less than or equal to? \u003c/td\u003e\n        \u003ctd\u003e 5 \u003c= 4 \u003c/td\u003e\n        \u003ctd\u003efalse\u003c/td\u003e\n    \u003c/tr\u003e\n    \u003ctr\u003e\n        \u003cth rowspan = \"2\"\u003e\u003e=\u003c/th\u003e\n        \u003ctd\u003e greater than or equal to? \u003c/td\u003e\n        \u003ctd\u003e 5 \u003e= 5 \u003c/td\u003e\n        \u003ctd\u003etrue\u003c/td\u003e\n    \u003c/tr\u003e\n    \u003ctr\u003e\n        \u003ctd\u003e greater than or equal to? \u003c/td\u003e\n        \u003ctd\u003e 5 \u003e= 6 \u003c/td\u003e\n        \u003ctd\u003efalse\u003c/td\u003e\n    \u003c/tr\u003e\n    \u003ctr\u003e\n        \u003cth rowspan = \"3\"\u003e==\u003c/th\u003e\n        \u003ctd\u003e equal to? \u003c/td\u003e\n        \u003ctd\u003e 5 == 5 \u003c/td\u003e\n        \u003ctd\u003etrue\u003c/td\u003e\n    \u003c/tr\u003e\n    \u003ctr\u003e\n        \u003ctd\u003e equal to? \u003c/td\u003e\n        \u003ctd\u003e 5 == 4 \u003c/td\u003e\n        \u003ctd\u003efalse\u003c/td\u003e\n    \u003c/tr\u003e\n    \u003ctr\u003e\n        \u003ctd\u003e equal to? \u003c/td\u003e\n        \u003ctd\u003e 5 == \"5\" \u003c/td\u003e\n        \u003ctd\u003etrue\u003c/td\u003e\n    \u003c/tr\u003e\n    \u003ctr\u003e\n        \u003cth rowspan = \"3\"\u003e!=\u003c/th\u003e\n        \u003ctd\u003e not equal to? \u003c/td\u003e\n        \u003ctd\u003e 5 != 5 \u003c/td\u003e\n        \u003ctd\u003efalse\u003c/td\u003e\n    \u003c/tr\u003e\n    \u003ctr\u003e\n        \u003ctd\u003e not equal to? \u003c/td\u003e\n        \u003ctd\u003e 5 != 4 \u003c/td\u003e\n        \u003ctd\u003etrue\u003c/td\u003e\n    \u003c/tr\u003e\n    \u003ctr\u003e\n        \u003ctd\u003e not equal to? \u003c/td\u003e\n        \u003ctd\u003e 5 != \"5\" \u003c/td\u003e\n        \u003ctd\u003efalse\u003c/td\u003e\n    \u003c/tr\u003e\n    \u003ctr\u003e\n        \u003cth rowspan = \"2\"\u003e===\u003c/th\u003e\n        \u003ctd\u003e \"strict\" equal to (includes type)? \u003c/td\u003e\n        \u003ctd\u003e 5 === \"5\" \u003c/td\u003e\n        \u003ctd\u003efalse\u003c/td\u003e\n    \u003c/tr\u003e\n    \u003ctr\u003e\n        \u003ctd\u003e \"strict equal\" to (includes type)? \u003c/td\u003e\n        \u003ctd\u003e 5 === 5 \u003c/td\u003e\n        \u003ctd\u003etrue\u003c/td\u003e\n    \u003c/tr\u003e\n    \u003ctr\u003e\n        \u003cth rowspan = \"2\"\u003e!==\u003c/th\u003e\n        \u003ctd\u003e \"strict\" not equal to (includes type)? \u003c/td\u003e\n        \u003ctd\u003e 5 !== \"5\" \u003c/td\u003e\n        \u003ctd\u003etrue\u003c/td\u003e\n    \u003c/tr\u003e\n    \u003ctr\u003e\n        \u003ctd\u003e \"strict\" not equal to (includes type)? \u003c/td\u003e\n        \u003ctd\u003e 5 !== 5 \u003c/td\u003e\n        \u003ctd\u003efalse\u003c/td\u003e\n    \u003c/tr\u003e\n\u003c/table\u003e\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n\u003cJSTerminal /\u003e\n\nWhile nearly all of these operators are shared amongst the majority of modern programming languages, the `===` (triple equals) is unique to JavaScript. The distinctions between `==` (double equals) and `===` (triple equals) are important. The double equals `==` operator is used to compare _only_ the value of two variables, while the \"strict\" triple equals `===` operator is used to compare the value _and_ type of two variables. The strict operator will only return true if the two variables are _exactly_ the same, both in value and in type (e.g., number or string). So, while both `5 === 5` and `\"5\" === \"5\"` will return true because they are the same value and type, `5 === \"5\"` will return false because the latter is testing a number against a string (discussed below). Also note the difference between the double equals `==` and triple equals `===`, which test for equality, and the `!=` and `!==` operators, which test for _inequality_.\n\nWe'll continue to work with comparison/equality operators throughout the course, so don't worry if they're still a bit unclear. Additionally, we have for now purposefully left out the `=` (single equals) operator, as it has a different function than evaluating equality. We'll cover the single equals operator later in this lesson.\n\n### Strings\n\nAs a data type, a __string__ is simply a series of alphanumeric characters, meaning it can combine both numbers and text into a phrase. Strings are mostly used for displaying or recognizing a series of text in your programs. You have actually already encountered a string--in the `console.log(\"Hello, World!\");` command you ran above, everything enclosed in the double-quotation marks (namely, `Hello, World!`) is considered a string. In the `\"5\" == \"5\"` example you just saw, each 5 is actually considered a _string_, rather than a number, because they are enclosed in quotation marks.\n\nJust like with numbers, you can simply type a string (for instance, `\"Hello, World!\"`) into the console and it will repeat your string back to you. It is important to note that were you to add a number to the string, e.g., `\"Hello, World in the Year 3030!\";`, the entire phrase would still be considered a string and _not_ a number. This is because you have enclosed it within double-quotation marks, which always indicates a `string` type.\n\nIt's worth noting that you can use both single- \u003ckbd\u003e'\u003c/kbd\u003e and double-quotation \u003ckbd\u003e\"\u003c/kbd\u003e marks to identify a string. It is important, however, to keep your use consistent. For instance, if you were to write `\"Hello, World!'`, beginning the phrase with double-quotes and ending with a single-quote, you will receive a `SyntaxError` (we'll cover how to deal with errors in a bit more detail later). It is best practice to primarily use double-quotes, as this allows you to use single-quotes _within_ a phrase without the console throwing errors. For example, `\"It is Jill's birthday.\"` is a perfectly valid expression, while `'It is Jill's birthday.'` is not.\n\n__Note__: If you need to use double-quotes inside of a string, there are two ways you can do this. You can, conversely, simply use single-quotation marks to surround a phrase, e.g., `'I wonder what \"truth\" means today?'`, or you can use a \u003ckbd\u003e\\\u003c/kbd\u003e (backslash) to precede a double-quotation mark within enclosed double-quotation marks, e.g. `\"I wonder what \\\"truth\\\" means today?\"`. \n\nStrings can also utilize the `+` operator to __concatenate__, or join, separate string phrases together. For example, `\"Hello, \" + \"World!\"` will return `\"Hello, World!\"`. Try it out in the console below.\n\n\u003cJSTerminal /\u003e\n\n### Boolean\n\nUnlike some real-world scenarios, determining what is true and false in JavaScript is refreshingly straightforward. __Booleans__ are data types that are either firmly `true` or `false`. In utilizing the comparison operators from the table earlier, you have already discovered how the console determines truth and falsity. For instance, typing `9 \u003e 5` evaluates to `true`, whereas `5 \u003e 9` evaluates to `false`. Similarly, `5 \u003e= 5` as well as `5 \u003c= 5` both resolve as `true`. If you simply type `true` or `false` into the console, the console recognizes it as a data type and will repeat it back to you.\n\nBooleans may seem simple, but very often in programming you will need a data type that can only have one of two values, akin to a \"yes\" or \"no\" or \"on\" or \"off\" determination. We will work more with booleans as we progress through the course.\n\nAs a final step for this lesson, let's make using data types a bit more interesting by introducing __variables__.\n\n## Variables\n\nNow that we have explored a number of data types and how to use them, let's explore how to create variables in JavaScript to utilize data types more effectively.\n\nYou can think of __variables__ as kinds of containers for data. They are named and can be assigned a value based on whatever data type is appropriate. To create a variable, you simply type the `var` keyword along with the name of the variable you want to create, followed by a single equal sign (`=`) and then the value of the variable. For example, `var myMessage = \"Hello, World!\";` will create a new variable called `myMessage` and assign it the value `\"Hello, World!\"`. Creating a variable is called __declaring__ or __defining__ it, and attributing a value to it is called __assigning__ it.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, this drastically sets apart the single equals `=` operator from the double equals `==` operator. The single equals operator is used to __assign__ a value to a variable, while the double equals operator (as well as the triple equals) is used to __test__ if two values or variables are equal to each other (without modifying either value).\n\nIn the example below, we have replicated our `Hello, World!` message, only this time using a variable. You can see that instead of simply logging the string `\"Hello, World!\"` to the console, we have assigned the string to a variable called `myMessage` and then logged the value of `myMessage` to the console.\n\n```JavaScript\n    var myMessage = \"Hello, World!\";\n    console.log(myMessage);\n```\n\nUnderstanding and working effectively with variables is probably the most important part of programming. They allow you to store data in memory, and then use that data to perform all kinds of operations upon it. Take a look at the example below:\n\n```JavaScript\nvar a = 1;\nvar b = 2;\nvar c = a + b;\n```\n\nYou'll notice that the variable `c` is assigned the value of `a + b`. In other words, here we are assigning the value of a variable to that of the addition of two other variables. What do you think the result would be if we were to `console.log(c);`? \n\nNow let's make something ever so slightly more interesting. Let's talk about the weather.\n\n```JavaScript\nvar weather = 'sunny';\nvar statement = 'The weather is ' + weather + ' today.';\n```\n\nEarlier, you saw how we can concatenate strings together to form a compound phrase. You can also use the `+` operator to combine strings and variables. In the above example, the variable `statement`, assigned `\"The weather is \" + weather + \" today.\"` will return the string `\"The weather is sunny today.\"`.\n\nAny of the data types you have already learned can be assigned to a variable. For example, you can assign a number to a variable, a string to a variable, a boolean to a variable, etc.\n\nAs your programs become more complex, it is generally good practice to declare all of your variables at the top of your program. This will make it easier to find and understand your code later. Take a look at the program below:\n\n```JavaScript\nvar book, author, isbn, description;\n\nbook = \"Hunger\";\nauthor = \"Knut Hamsun\";\nisbn = 0374525285;\n\ndescription = \"The book \" + book + \" by \" + author + \" is on ISBN \" + isbn;\nconsole.log(description);\n\nbook = \"The Master and Margarita\";\nauthor = \"Mikhail Bulgakov\";\nisbn = 0679760806;\n\ndescription = \"The book \" + book + \" by \" + author + \" is on ISBN \" + isbn;\nconsole.log(description);\n```\n\nAs you can see, we have declared all the variables we want to include for our categorization of the books at the top of the program.  It is important to note that these variables persist only for the duration of your particular session with the console. If you close the console, they will be deleted from memory. You will also notice, however, that the values of the variables are __mutable__, meaning that they can be changed as the program progresses. If you run this program in the console, each `console.log()` command will display a new description. __Note__: Certain variable types are immutable, meaning that they cannot be changed. We'll explore additional details about immutable variables in later lessons.\n\n### Variable Naming Conventions\n\nThere are a few rules for variable naming conventions in JavaScript. \n- Variables must begin with a letter or an underscore. You can't begin a variable name with a number (although you can use numbers after). \n- Variables must not contain spaces or special characters. For example, `myVariable` is a valid variable name, but `my variable` is not.\n- Variable names are case sensitive. That is, a variable named `My_Books` is treated as an entirely different variable than one named `my_books`.\n- You can't use one of JavaScript's reserved words as a variable name. All programming languages have a supply of words that are used internally by the language. For a complete list, see here: [Reserved Words](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_reserved.asp).\n- Do not include hyphens `-`. Hyphens can be misconstrued by JavaScript as attempts to subtract one value from another and will cause errors.\n\nIn general, try to keep your variable names as short and descriptive of their purpose as possible.\n\n## Using typeof\n\nLet's end our discussion of variables with one more nifty tool: the `typeof` operator. The `typeof` operator is used to determine the data type of a variable. For example, if you have a variable named `myVariable`, you can use the `typeof` operator to determine what kind of data it is.\n\n```JavaScript\nvar myVariable = \"Hello, World!\";\nconsole.log(typeof myVariable);\n```\n\nIf you look at your developer console, you should see a `string` correctly identified as the data type of `myVariable`. You can use this operator to determine the data type of any variable you have created. This can become very useful when you are working with data types that are not explicitly defined or when you are converting data types from one type to another (which we'll begin learning in the next lesson).\n\n## Review Questions\n\nLet's review some of the main concepts we've covered in this lesson and get some practice in.\n\n1. `console.log()` is best used for (select one):\n\n\u003cQuiz\u003e\n- testing and debugging your code*\n- changing the appearance of a webpage\n- warning the user about something\n\u003c/Quiz\u003e\n\n2. Select all of the following statements that will evaluate to `true`:\n\n\u003cQuiz\u003e\n- 5*\n- 5 = 5\n- 5 == 5*\n- 5 != 5\n- 5 === 5*\n- 5 !== \"5\"*\n\u003c/Quiz\u003e\n\n3. Which of these variable names are legal (valid) in JavaScript? (select all that apply)\n\n\u003cQuiz\u003e\n- my_books* \n- myBooks*\n- my-books\n- myBooks1*\n- 1my_books\n- myBooks\u0026I\n\u003c/Quiz\u003e\n\n## Challenges\n\n1. In JavaScript, as in typical algebra, ambiguity in a mathematical expression is resolved by [rules of precedence (PEMDAS)](https://www.purplemath.com/modules/orderops.htm). For example, the expression `5 + 5` is evaluated as `10`, while the expression `5 + 5 * 5` is evaluated as `30`. Using the rules of precedence and the console, rework the expression `5 + 5 * 10 /2` so that it resolves to `50`. Next, utilizing the variables defined below, write an expression that resolves to `true` using the double equals `==` operator.\n\n```JavaScript\nvar a = 15;\nvar b = 10;\nvar c = 30;\nvar d = 5;\n```\n\n\u003cJSTerminal /\u003e\n\n2. Using variables, write a simple program that 1) sends an `alert` to the user telling them to open the developer console in their browser and 2) logs a message to the console saying they have won a prize. __Note__: This is an imaginary practice scenario. In reality, you would want to avoid using `console.log()` to send messages to users when actually deploying your website. Any information you want the user of your webpage to see should be presented on the webpage itself.\n\n## Key Terms\n\nDo you recall the meaning of the following terms from this lesson?\n- boolean\n- string\n- variable\n- concatenation\n- declaration/assignment\n- mutability\n\n# Control Flow\n\nSo far in this course, we have been working with fairly simple programming structures. Our code thus far has been written as a single, linear, ordered list of instructions. However, there are other ways to structure your code that takes account of various conditions and reacts accordingly. \n\nWe are speaking here about __control flow__: the order in which the computer executes statements in a script.\n\nIn general, code is run in order from the first line in the file to the last line, unless the computer runs across the (extremely frequent) structures that change the control flow, such as conditionals and loops. We will explore several of these structures in this lesson and learn how to use them to create dynamic, branching programs. To put these skills to work, at the end of the lesson you will learn to build your own small text-based \"Choose Your Own Adventure\" game that allows players/readers to change the outcomes of a story based on their decisions. Let's get started! \n\n## Thinking in Code\n\nLet's talk about the process of thinking in code. What does someone think about before they write code? In your head, how might you imagine what the code in action would look like? \n\nIn general, we might present a few initial ideas about the process:\n1. The computer reads from top to bottom. It does things according to the instructions it reads, step by step. That's the sense in which we mean 'scripting'. My thought process is about the steps that are necessary to get from the beginning to a defined end. What kind of data do I have? How will it have to be transformed? What will be the result? That's the linear vision of scripting.\n2. Digging into the code is a lot more difficult and we really need to envision its structure. What might the structure of the code look like? What is the structure of the data itself? That's the hierarchical vision of scripting.\n3. A branching, rather than linear, vision of code is about the decisions that are made in the process of getting to the end. The branches in the program are equivalent to a \"decision tree.\" \n\n![Decision Tree](/images/decision-tree.drawio.png)\n\nThe decision tree is a visual representation of the process of getting to the end of a program. The diagram above shows how code will follow the different \"branches\" depending on the truth or falsity of a certain condition.\n\nTo aid us in thinking about what our program might look like, let's also consider what a typical \"Choose Your Own Adventure\" game would consist of. In simple terms, it would need:\n1. A predefined story (the story that the player is told)\n2. A set of choices that the player can make at certain points in the story \n3. An internal way to change the story based on the player's choices (code branching)\n4. A set of outcomes that the player can see based on their choices \n\nLet's keep these ideas in mind and use them as a rough roadmap for the rest of the lesson.\n\nFor now, let's not worry about the details of the story. Let's first start by exploring a simple way to allow the player to make choices and a way to store those choices.\n\n## Prompts\n\nOne of the simplest ways to gather user input is through the `prompt()` function. This function displays a message to the user and waits for them to enter a response in the response field. The `prompt()` function returns the user's response as a string. Let's take a look at it in detail.\n\n```JavaScript\n    var userName = prompt(\"What is your name?\");\n```\nHere is a simple example of the `prompt()` function in action. The user is asked to enter their name and waits for them to type it out and hit \u003ckbd\u003eEnter\u003c/kbd\u003e. Once the user completes their name, their response will be stored in the variable `userName`. In other words, the function __returns__ the value you enter and stores it in the variable. we'll learn more about returns in a later lesson discussion functions. For now, try running the code in the console below, answer the prompt, and then type `userName` in the console to see that the variable is now populated with the name you have entered.\n\n\u003cJSTerminal /\u003e\n\nPretty nifty, right? `Prompt` code is like `alert` code, with a couple differences:\n1. In a prompt, you need a way to capture the user's response. So, you must begin the prompt with a variable declaration.\n2. In a prompt, you can specify a second message, which acts as a \"default\" value. If the user doesn't enter a response, the default message will be stored in the variable. For instance, we might make a prompt like: `var whatAmI = prompt(\"What am I?\", \"I am a human!\");`, in which `I am a human!` will prepopulate the response field and act as the default return value if the user doesn't enter anything themselves. \n\n### parseInt()\n\nIt's important to note that the user's response to a `prompt` is _always_ a string. If you want to store and handle the user's response as a number (so you can perform arithmetic on it), you will need to convert it to a number using the `parseInt()` function. The `parseInt()` function takes a string and returns the number it represents. For example, `parseInt(\"5\")` will return `5` (the number).\n\nLet's try this out now, this time asking the user their age:\n\n```JavaScript\n    var userAge = prompt(\"How old are you?\");\n    userAge = parseInt(userAge);\n    alert(\"You are \" + userAge + \" years old.\");\n    typeof userAge;\n```\n\n\u003cJSTerminal /\u003e\n\nFor this example we simply update `userAge` with the new conversion value. As you can see by checking with `typeof`, the user's response is now registered as a number.\n\n__Note:__ This is not a foolproof data type conversion tactic and is easily broken. For instance, if you type the response \"one\" into the prompt instead of 1, the `parseInt` function will return a `NaN` (Not a Number) value. The `NaN` value is a special value that is returned when you try to perform arithmetic on a value that is not recognized as a number. For our purposes at the moment, however, this technique will suffice.\n\n## If/Else Statements\n\nSo far so good--we now have a way to capture user input. However, we don't yet have a way to react or respond to that input. For this we can use a different kind of structure called an __if/else statement__. These statements allow us to make decisions based on the value of a variable.\n\nThe basic structure of an `if/else` statement is:\n\n```JavaScript\n    if (condition) {\n        // code to run if condition is true\n    } else {\n        // code to run if condition is false\n    }\n```\n\nIf statements work like \"_If condition is met, then execute the task_\". In other words, the code in the `if` \"block\" will run if the `condition` (whatever it may be) is true and skip the `else` block, and the code in the `else` block will run if the `condition` is false and skip the initial `if` block. Note the beginning and ending curly braces `{}` surrounding each branch of the code: `if` and `else` always utilize curly braces, rather than semicolons. These braces always indicate a particular block of code and you will encounter them in many contexts.\n\nThe other new thing of note here is the text following the two forward slashes `//`: these are called __comments__. Comments are used to explain the code and are not executed by the computer. They are purely for human readers. As we continue to build more complex programs, we will often use comments to explain the code. Writing comments for yourself is an important way to make sure that you recall the purpose of the code you are writing if you return to it later. It also helps others reading your code to understand your intentions as well.\n\nLet's look at a more concrete example of an if/else statement, modifying our \"get the user's age\" program from above and seeing if they are legally eligible to vote (as far as age goes) in the U.S. Try running the code in the console below.\n\n```JavaScript\n    var userAge = prompt(\"How old are you?\");\n    userAge = parseInt(userAge);\n    if (userAge \u003e= 18) {\n        alert(\"You are legally old enough to vote in the U.S.\");\n    } else {\n        alert(\"You are not legally old enough to vote in the U.S.\");\n    }\n```\n\n\u003cJSTerminal /\u003e\n\nAfter gathering the user input and performing the conversion, we then use an `if/else` statement to determine if the user is old enough to vote (that is, we check to see if they are 18 years or older). \n\n## Else If Statements\n\nUsing `else if`, you can utilize as many statements as you want in your code to check as many conditions as you need. Try running the following example in the console:\n\n```JavaScript    \n    var userAge = prompt(\"How old are you?\");\n    userAge = parseInt(userAge);\n\n    if (userAge \u003e= 18) {\n        alert(\"You are legally old enough to vote and drive in the U.S.\");\n    } else if (userAge \u003e= 16) {\n        alert(\"You are not old enough to vote, but you are old enough to drive in the U.S.\");\n    } else {\n        alert(\"You are not legally old enough to vote or drive in the U.S.\");\n    }\n```\n\n\u003cJSTerminal /\u003e\n\nThe first `if` statement checks to see if the user is old enough to purchase vote. If they are, the `alert` message is displayed. If they are not, the second statement `else if` checks to see if they are at least able to drive. If they are, the `alert` message is displayed. If they are not, the final `else` statement displays the last `alert` message. The final `else` statement in a series is usually considered a default case or catchall to execute if none of the other `if/else` statements are true.\n\nAlong with testing as many conditions as you want, you can also run as many lines of code as you want in each block. You can even chain together a series of `if/else` statements. This is called __nesting__. For example:\n\n```JavaScript\nif (condition1){\n    // code to run if condition1 is true\n    if (condition2){\n        // code to run if condition2 is true\n        if (condition3){\n            // code to run if condition3 is true\n        } else {\n            // code to run if condition3 is false\n        }\n    } else {\n        // code to run if condition2 is false\n    }\n} else {\n    // code to run if condition1 is false\n}\n```\n\nAs you might be able to tell from just this example, too many nested `if/else` statements can be hard to read and hard to maintain, so try to keep them to a minimum whenever possible.\n\nTo help you understand how each block of this conditional cascade is structured, take a look at the diagram below:\n\n![if/else diagram](/images/if-else-diagram.png)\n\nThe arrows indicate the beginning (opening) and ending (closing) braces of a particular `if/else` statement. By matching the colors of each statement, you can see how the curly braces are continually nesting and designating their own blocks of code. While many modern code editors have their own built-in syntax highlighting (or coloring) as well as automatic indentation and bracing to make our code more visually understandable, it is still important to keep a close eye on your code and make sure you are following the correct structure and working in the correct block. \n\n## Switch Statements\n\nSwitch statements are another control flow structure used to handle multiple conditions. They are perhaps not as common, but they are useful to cover here briefly, as they can have a cleaner syntax than creating overly complex chains of `if/else` statements.\n\nThe basic structure of a switch statement is:\n\n```JavaScript\n    switch (variable) {\n        case value1:\n            // code to run if `variable` is `value1`\n            break;\n        case value2:\n            // code to run if `variable` is `value2`\n            break;\n        case value3:\n            // code to run if `variable` is `value3`\n            break;\n        default:\n            // code to run if `variable` is not `value1`, `value2`, or `value3`\n            break;\n    }\n```\n\nLike the `if/else` statement, the `switch` statement is broken into a series of `case` statements. Each `case` statement is a condition that the `switch` statement will check. The `switch` statement will then execute the code in the block that is associated with the first `case` statement that is evaluated as true. If none of the `case` statements are true, the `default` block will be executed.\n\nThe `break` statement is used to break out of the `switch` statement. The `break` statement is not required, but it is recommended to use it. If you omit the `break` statement, the `switch` statement will continue to execute the code in the next `case` statements even if they do not match the case.\n\nLet's take a look at a more concrete example of a `switch` statement. Let's say we were creating a computer game, and wanted to let the player pick a difficulty setting. Take a look at the following code and run it in the console:\n\n```JavaScript\n    var difficulty = prompt(\"What difficulty would you like to play? 1- Easy, 2- Medium, 3- Hard\");\n    switch (difficulty) {\n        case \"1\":\n            alert(\"You have selected the Easy difficulty.\");\n            break;\n        case \"2\":\n            alert(\"You have selected the Medium difficulty.\");\n            break;\n        case \"3\":\n            alert(\"You have selected the Hard difficulty.\");\n            break;\n        default:\n            alert(\"Invalid entry.\");\n            break;\n    }\n```\n\u003cJSTerminal /\u003e\n\nHere we have three different difficulty levels (although you can have as many levels or `cases` as you want in a `switch` statement). The first `case` statement checks to see if the user entered `1`, the second `case` statement checks to see if the user entered `2`, and the final `case` statement checks to see if the user entered `3`. If the user entered `1`, `2`, or `3`, the `alert` message is displayed. If the user entered anything else, the `default` block is executed and an error message is shown. \n\nWhile this simple example could also easily be written using `if/else` statements, in your programming journey there may be times when writing a `switch` statement is more appropriate than writing many unwieldy `if/else` statements. Did you notice how many less curly braces you had to keep track of when writing a `switch` structure? Readability is just as important as functionality in programming.\n\n## Choose Your Own Adventure\n\nNow that you have a better understanding of some basic control flow structures in JavaScript, it's time to put them to work creating a simple Choose Your Own Adventure game using `prompt` for input and `alert()` for output. Since our game is meant to be a piece of interactive fiction, we'll want to use a variable to track player choices, and perhaps also let the player input their name to personalize the game and get things started.\n\n```JavaScript\n    var playerName, playerChoice;\n\n    var playerName = prompt(\"What is your name?\");\n    alert(\"Welcome, \" + playerName + \"!\");\n```\n\nNext, we can begin adding our story. I am going to show you an example, but feel free to get creative and write a story of your own. For my example, I am going to adapt the first two lines of Fredric Brown’s short story “Knock,” written in 1948. These two lines are a complete story in themselves and are widely considered one of the shortest and yet most evocative horror/sci fi stories to date. In Brown’s story, the first two lines are as follows: \n\n\u003e “The last man on earth sat alone in a room.  There was a knock on the door.”\n\nI’m going to have some fun with this story and let the player decide what to do next. I will also modify the language a bit—because we are creating a Choose Your Own Adventure story, we want to use second person phrasing (you). So, my story will look rather like this:\n\n```JavaScript\n    alert(playerName + \", you are the last person on earth, sitting alone in a room. There is a knock on the door... What will you do?\");\n    playerChoice = prompt(\"Enter 1 to cautiously approach the door. Enter 2 to hide under the table.\");\n    if (playerChoice == \"1\"){\n        alert(\"Your hands are trembling as you approach the door. You pause a moment before it.\");\n    } else if (playerChoice == \"2\"){\n        alert(\"As you hide under the table you hear the doorknob rattling.\");\n    }\n    else {\n        alert(\"Invalid entry.\");\n    }\n```\n\nHere we have given the player two options by entering either `1` or `2` into the prompt. Now that we have their first options, we can add further options by nesting additional `if` statements:\n\n```JavaScript\n    if (playerChoice == \"1\"){\n        alert(\"Your hands are trembling as you approach the door. You pause a moment before it.\");\n        playerChoice = prompt(\"Enter 1 to bravely open the door. Enter 2 to look through the door's peephole.\");\n        if (playerChoice == \"1\"){\n            alert(\"You swing the door open with courageous gusto.\")\n        }\n        else if (playerChoice == \"2\"){\n            alert(\"You cautiously look through the peephole. You make out a vague shape looming before the door.\")\n        }\n        else {\n            alert(\"Invalid entry.\");\n        }\n    } else if (playerChoice == \"2\"){\n        alert(\"As you hide under the table you hear the doorknob rattling.\");\n        playerChoice = prompt(\"Enter 1 to stay hidden under the table. Enter 2 to get up and find a weapon to defend yourself with.\");\n        if (playerChoice == \"1\"){\n            alert(\"Whatever is at the door has now begun banging on it loudly.\");\n        }\n        else if (playerChoice == \"2\"){\n            alert(\"You quickly but quietly get up and look around. You see a broom in the corner of the room and wield it mightily.\");\n        }\n        else {\n            alert(\"Invalid entry.\");\n        }\n    }\n    else {\n        alert(\"Invalid entry.\");\n    }\n```\n\nOkay, now we have some additional options for the player to choose from, along with more error messages if they choose incorrectly. Putting it all together then, here is the story so far:\n\n```JavaScript\n    var playerName, playerChoice;\n\n    var playerName = prompt(\"What is your name?\");\n    alert(\"Welcome, \" + playerName + \"!\");\n\n    alert(playerName + \", you are the last person on earth, sitting alone in a room. There is a knock on the door... What will you do?\");\n    playerChoice = prompt(\"Enter 1 to cautiously approach the door. Enter 2 to hide under the table.\");\n    if (playerChoice == \"1\"){\n        alert(\"Your hands are trembling as you approach the door. You pause a moment before it.\");\n        playerChoice = prompt(\"Enter 1 to bravely open the door. Enter 2 to look through the door's peephole.\");\n        if (playerChoice == \"1\"){\n            alert(\"You swing the door open with courageous gusto.\")\n        }\n        else if (playerChoice == \"2\"){\n            alert(\"You cautiously look through the peephole. You make out a vague shape looming before the door.\")\n        }\n        else {\n            alert(\"Invalid entry.\");\n        }\n    } else if (playerChoice == \"2\"){\n        alert(\"As you hide under the table you hear the doorknob rattling.\");\n        playerChoice = prompt(\"Enter 1 to stay hidden under the table. Enter 2 to get up and find a weapon to defend yourself with.\");\n        if (playerChoice == \"1\"){\n            alert(\"Whatever is at the door has now begun banging on it loudly.\");\n        }\n        else if (playerChoice == \"2\"){\n            alert(\"You quickly but quietly get up and look around. You see a broom in the corner of the room and wield it mightily.\");\n        }\n        else {\n            alert(\"Invalid entry.\");\n        }\n    }\n    else {\n        alert(\"Invalid entry.\");\n    }\n```\n\nTry writing a short story of your own in the code editor below. (You can also copy/paste the code from mine if you want to see it in action.)\n\n\u003cCodeEditor language='JavaScript' height = '450px'\u003e\n\u003c/CodeEditor\u003e\n\nWhile this approach to creating a Choose Your Own Adventure program works, it is very clunky and quite hard to read. As we said before, simply using a bunch of nested `if/else` statements makes a program incredibly difficult to build and maintain. Also, if the player incorrectly inputs a number, this program simply exits rather than prompting them to try again. Thankfully, JavaScript has many tools to help us address these issues. As we continue to learn more about the language, we will learn to use more control flow structures and data types to make our programs more readable and maintainable. Specifically, in the next lesson we will begin learning about loops and how to use them to repeat blocks of code, iterate over a series of values, and make our programs more efficient overall.\n\n## Review Questions\n\nLet's review the concepts we have learned in this lesson.\n\n1.

We will also learn to work with a very versatile new data type called `arrays`. To put these skills to work, at the end of the lesson we will create a simple library app that allows users to search for a book and see if it is located in the library's collection. \n\n## Arrays\n\nLet's begin by learning about the `array` data type. So far, you have encountered variables that only contain a single value. An array, in contrast, is a _series_ or a _collection_ of values stored in a single variable. The following is an example of four different arrays:\n\n```JavaScript\nvar myArray1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\nvar myArray2 = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e'];\nvar myArray3 = [true, false, true, false];\nvar myArray4 = [1, 2, 'dog', true, [1, 2, 3]];\n```\n\nCreating an array is just like other variable declarations you have seen, but the items it contains are always denoted by square brackets `[]`. An array can house any of the data types we have encountered so far. The first array, for example, contains a series of numbers, the second array contains a series of letters, and the third array contains a series of booleans. Arrays are very versatile and can also contain a mix of different data types, like in the fourth example. As you can see, this array even contains another array `[1, 2, 3]`!\n\nArrays are useful when you want to have a series of values that are easily accessible. Creating an individual variable for each of the values in the example above, for instance, would make your code very confusing and hard to work with.\n\nLet's look at how we can access the values in an array.\n\n## Accessing Values in an Array\n\nTo work with particular values in an array, we access its __index__. Values in an array are numbered starting from 0. The first value in an array is at index 0, the second value at index 1, and so on. Take a look at the example below:\n\n```JavaScript\nvar myArray = [1, 2, 'dog', true, [1, 2, 3]];\nalert(myArray[0]); // returns 1\n```\n\nWe access the index of an array by using the square brackets `[]` and the corresponding index number. The code snippet above will `alert` the value at index 0 of the array `myArray`. Remember, 0 is the _first_ value in an array, 1 is the _second_ value, and so on.\n\nTry using `alert` to display the value for each of the items from the example in the code editor below:\n\n\u003cCodeEditor language='JavaScript'\u003e\n    \u003c/CodeEditor\u003e\n\nAs you can see, when you access the value at index 4 (`myArray[4]`), you get the value `1, 2, 3`. Again, this is because the value at index 4 is an array itself.\n\n## Changing Values in an Array\n\nTo change the value at a particular index in an array, we use the same syntax. We use the square brackets `[]` and the index number to access the value, and then assign that index a new value.\n\n```JavaScript\nvar myArray = [1, 2, 'dog', true, [1, 2, 3]];\nmyArray[0] = 'cat';\nalert(myArray[0]); // returns 'cat'\n```\n\nIn this example, the value at index 0 (originally `1`) will be changed to `'cat'`.\n\n## Adding Values to an Array\n\nTo add a new value to the end of an array, we use the `push()` method. This method takes a single value and adds it to the end of the array.\n\n```JavaScript\nvar myArray = [1, 2, 'dog', true, [1, 2, 3]];\nmyArray.push('cat');\nalert(myArray[5]); // returns 'cat'\n```\n\nThis code adds the value `'cat'` to the end of the array `myArray`.\n\n## Removing Values from an Array\n\nTo remove a value from an array, we can use the `pop()` method. This method removes the last value in the array.\n\n```JavaScript\nvar myArray = [1, 2, 'dog', true, [1, 2, 3]];\nmyArray.pop();\nalert(myArray[4]);\n```\n\nTry running this code in the code editor below.\n\n\u003cCodeEditor language='JavaScript'\u003e\n    \u003c/CodeEditor\u003e\n\nOh no, we are now getting a message of `undefined`! But this is exactly what we intended to happen, because the `pop()` method removed the last value in the array. So, when we try to access it, JavaScript finds nothing there.\n\n## Splicing an Array\n\nIf we want to remove a range of values from an array or start at a particular index, we can use the `splice()` method. This method takes two parameters: the first parameter is the index number of the first value we want to start from and remove, and the second parameter is the number of values to remove in total.\n\n```JavaScript\nvar myArray = [1, 2, 'dog', true, [1, 2, 3]];\nmyArray.splice(0, 2);\nalert(myArray[0]); // returns 'dog'\n```\n\nIn this example, the first two values in the array `myArray` are removed (we start at index 0 and remove two values total). After the operation, the value at index 0 is now `'dog'`.\n\n## Determining the Length of an Array\n\nIt may not always be clear to you how many values are actually stored in a particular array at any given time, especially if it becomes very large or you are adding and removing a lot of elements. To determine the number of values in an array, we use the `length` property. The `length` property returns the number of values in an array. For example:\n\n```JavaScript\nvar myArray = [1, 2, 'dog', true, [1, 2, 3]];\nalert(myArray.length); // returns 5\n```\n\nWe utilize `length` by prefacing it with a `.` (dot). This is called _dot notation_, and indicates we are working with a __method__. We'll cover what exactly methods are in later lessons, but for now keep in mind you utilize `length` with a dot and the array you want to work with.\n\nAs you can see, `length` counts through the values in the array, so it will return 5. It is important to note here that `length` starts with 1, not 0, so although the last value in the array is at index 4, `length` will still return 5. Confusing, right? It is simply a quirk of the language to get used to, so keep it in mind when working with arrays.\n\nAs an example, if you want to access the last value in the array, you can use the `[length - 1]` syntax. This will always return the last value in the array:\n\n```JavaScript\nvar myArray = [1, 2, 'dog', true, [1, 2, 3]];\nalert(myArray[myArray.length - 1]); // returns [1, 2, 3]\n```\n\nThis is a useful way to access the last value in an array even when you don't know how many elements the array holds.\n\n## The sort() Method\n\nLet's take a look at one last method that we can use on arrays. The `sort()` method sorts an array in alphabetical order, and is particularly useful if you have an array of letters or strings:\n\n```JavaScript\nvar myArray = ['c', 'b', 'a', 'e', 'd'];\nmyArray.sort();\nalert(myArray); // returns ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']\n```\n\nYou can, however, also use the `sort()` method to sort an array in numerical order. For example:\n\n```JavaScript\nvar myArray = [2, 4, 3, 1, 5];\nmyArray.sort();\nalert(myArray); // returns [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n```\n\nThere are [many other methods](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_array_methods.asp) you can perform on arrays, and we have only scratched the surface here. But keep in mind that arrays are a powerful tool for storing and manipulating data. Let's now take a look at how we can loop through arrays to make our code more efficient.\n\n## Looping Through an Array\n\nWe have so far seen how we can access values in an array, and manipulate them in ways that are useful. But what if we want to do something with every value in an array? For instance, if we wanted to access every value in an array, it would be very tedious to write out the same code over and over, referencing each and every item:\n\n```JavaScript\nmyArray[0];\nmyArray[1];\nmyArray[2];\nmyArray[3];\n...\n```\n\nThankfully, we can do this in a more efficient way. Let's explore a new kind of technique called __looping__. Looping is a way to iterate through a structure and perform an action on each element.\n\n## The For Loop\n\nWhen you want to loop through an array, the most common way is with a `for` loop. This loop will __iterate__ or step through the array and execute a block of code for each value in the array.\n\nThe general structure of a `for` loop is as follows:\n\n```JavaScript\nfor (var i = 0; i \u003c array.length; i++) {\n    // do something\n}\n```\n\nTODO: Reverse logic, explain more clearly, add another example\n\nThis may look a little complicated, so let's explore it a bit. The `for` loop is comprised of three parts: the first part is the initialization of the loop, which is the variable `i` in this case (`i` is often used by convention, but the variable name can be anything you want). The second part is the condition that the loop will continue to execute until, and the third part is the incrementor. Each is separated by a semi-colon `;`.\n\nTo break it down a little more:\n- `var i = 0`: This is the starting point of the loop. It will serve as the index number of the first element in the array.\n- `i \u003c array.length`: This is the condition of the loop. It is a boolean expression that determines whether the loop should continue. In other words, it says: \"while `i` is less than the `length` of the array, do the following:\".\n- `i++`: This is the incrementor. `++` is a new operator that means that the value of `i` will increase or __increment__ by 1 each time the loop executes. We use it to increment the index number of the loop so that it will continually move to the next element in the array. \n\n Let's see how this works in action using our `myArray` array from earlier:\n\n```JavaScript\nvar myArray = [1, 2, 'dog', true, [1, 2, 3]];\nfor (var i = 0; i \u003c myArray.length; i++) {\n    alert(myArray[i]);\n}\n```\n\nTry running this code in the code editor below.\n\n\u003cCodeEditor language='JavaScript'\u003e\n    \u003c/CodeEditor\u003e\n\nAs you can see, the loop iterated through the array and alerted each value in the array. You'll notice that the loop executed the alert 5 times instead of displaying all the values at once. This is because the loop is executing the alert once for each value in the array. In other words, the code inside the `for` loop block executes once for each value in the array based on the current value of `i`. So, if there are 5 values in the array, the loop will execute 5 times.\n\n## The While Loop\n\nThe `while` loop is similar to the `for` loop, but it will infinitely execute the code inside a loop until a certain specified condition is met. This is useful if you want a certain code block to run until a particular outcome is resolved. Try running the example in the code editor below: \n\n```JavaScript\nvar i = 0;\nwhile (i \u003c 5) {\n    alert(i);\n    i++;\n}\n```\n\n\u003cCodeEditor language='JavaScript'\u003e\n    \u003c/CodeEditor\u003e\n\nAs you can see, the loop executed the alert 5 times, incrementing the value of `i` each time. In other words, this loop is saying: \"while `i` is less than 5, do the following:\".\n\n__Note:__ It is very important to make sure your `while` loops ultimately end by satisfying the condition you specify. If you don't, the loop will continue forever, and the user will be required to force-quit your program or close the window to stop it.\n\n## Putting It All Together - The Library App\n\nLet's use the skills we've learned in this lesson to create a simple app that will allow us to sort, display, and search for book titles from our library.\n\nTo begin, let's imagine a number of fiction titles that are available in our library and add them to an array. We'll sort this array to put it in alphabetical order.\n\n```JavaScript\nvar bookTitles = [\n    'Too Loud a Solitude',\n    'Things Fall Apart',\n    'The Master and Margarita',\n    'The Three Body Problem',\n    'The Woman Destroyed',\n    'Beloved',\n    'The Tenant of Wildfell Hall',\n    \"Lady Chatterley's Lover\",\n];\n\nbookTitles.sort()\nvar requestedTitle = \"\";\nvar libRequests = []\n```\n\nBecause we want to get book requests from the user, an empty string `requestedTitle` will store the title of the book that the user requested in the prompt, and an empty array `libRequests` will store all the many requests the user may enter.\n\nNext, let's give the user a short welcome message. We will also let them know they can make a request by typing `request` at the prompt, display all book titles by typing `display`, or quit the program by typing `quit`:\n\n```JavaScript\nalert(\"Welcome to the library!\\n\\nPlease search for a book title when prompted.\\n\\nType `request` at the prompt to make a request for a book.\\n\\nYou can also type `display` at the prompt to display all available book titles.\\n\\nType `quit` at the prompt to quit the program.\");\n```\n\nOur welcome message gives the user a few options for what they can do. To keep the text display neat, we use `\\n` characters (specifically 2 in this case) to create two new lines after each statement.\n\nAt this point, we can envision a few things about how our program should operate:\n- We want to allow the user to search for books until they decide to quit. So, a `while` loop will be needed.\n- We want to check if the user types `request` or `display` at the prompt. If they do, we want to perform the appropriate action. So, we will need several `if/else` statements. \n- We want to iterate through the array of book titles and display each one. So, we can use a `for` loop to accomplish this.\n\nOkay, conceptually we have the basic toolkit. However, we are missing one crucial piece. We want the program to check if a book title the user enters is actually in the library. That is, we want to see if the string the user enters matches an item in the array `bookTitles`. How can we do this? Let's introduce one more new method: `indexOf`.\n\n### indexOf\n\n`indexOf` is a method that returns the index of the first occurrence of a value in an array. If the value is not found, it will return `-1`. Here's an example:\n\n```JavaScript\nvar myArray = ['dog', 'cat', 'bird', 'fish'];\nmyArray.indexOf('dog'); // returns 0\nmyArray.indexOf('cat'); // returns 1\nmyArray.indexOf('bird'); // returns 2\nmyArray.indexOf('fish'); // returns 3\nmyArray.indexOf('cow'); // returns -1\n```\n\nUsing this method, we can check if a book title the user enters is in the library (if the string the user enters matches an item in the array `bookTitles`). If it doesn't (if the method returns `-1`), we can alert the user that the book they requested is not in the library.\n\nWith this method we should now have everything we need. Let's put the whole program together:\n\n```JavaScript\nvar bookTitles = [\n    'Too Loud a Solitude',\n    'Things Fall Apart',\n    'The Master and Margarita',\n    'The Three Body Problem',\n    'The Woman Destroyed',\n    'Beloved',\n    'The Tenant of Wildfell Hall',\n    \"Lady Chatterley's Lover\",\n];\n\nbookTitles.sort();\nvar libRequests = [];\nvar requestedTitle = \"\";\n\nalert(\"Welcome to the library!\\n\\nPlease search for a book title when prompted.\\n\\nType `request` at the prompt to make a request for a book.\\n\\nYou can also type `display` at the prompt to display all available book titles.\\n\\nType `quit` at the prompt to quit the program.\");\n\nvar response = \"\";\nwhile (response != 'quit') {\n    response = prompt(\"Search for a book title or make a request by typing 'request': \");\n    // check if the user wants to make a request\n    if (response == 'request') {\n        requestedTitle = prompt(\"What book would you like to request? \");\n        libRequests.push(requestedTitle); // add the requested title to the library requests array\n        alert(\"You have requested the following titles:\" + libRequests + \".\"); // alert the user their requests\n    }\n    // check if the user wants to display all the titles\n    else if (response == 'display') {\n        for (var i = 0; i \u003c bookTitles.length; i++) {\n            alert(bookTitles[i]); // display all available book titles\n            }\n    }\n    // otherwise, check if the book the user entered is in the library\n    else {\n        var bookIndex = bookTitles.indexOf(response);\n        if (response != 'quit'){\n            // if indexOf returns -1, the book the user entered is not in the library\n            if (bookIndex == -1) {\n                alert(\"Sorry, we don't have that book. You can always request it.\");\n            }\n            else {\n                alert(\"Yes, \" + response + \" is available to check out.\");\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nTry running and exploring the program:\n\n\u003cCodeEditor language='JavaScript'\u003e\n    \u003c/CodeEditor\u003e\n\nLet's break down the logic of the program a bit. First, we have a `var response = \"\";` line. This is an empty string variable declaration meant to store the user's response to the prompt. We will use this variable to determine whether or not the user wants to make a request, display, or quit, or else search for the book in our library. Next, we have a `while` loop that will continue to execute until the user types `quit`. Within the `while` loop, we first check if the user's response is `request` or `display`. If it is, we can perform the appropriate action using `if/else if` statements. To display all book titles, we use a `for` loop to alert each book. If the response is not a defined user action (i.e., request, display, quit), we can check if the string is in the library. We use the `indexOf` method to check if the `response` string is in the library. If it is, we can alert the user that the book is available to check out. If it isn't (if the method returns `-1`), we can alert the user that the book is not in the library.\n\nCongratulations! You have now successfully created a basic library search program. There are, of course, a number of limitations to this program. For instance: \n- The search parameters are not very robust. The user must type out the full title of the book, with the exact spelling and punctuation of the title. As you might imagine, this is not a very good user experience.\n- The `for` loop sends an alert for each book in the library. This is not ideal, especially if we had a large amount of books. We would want to display the books in a more organized manner.\n\nThese are basic considerations we would want to take into account if we were actually designing a library search program. However, if you can understand how this program works, you are well on your way to creating complex and robust JavaScript programs. To get some more practice in, try out the challenges below.\n\n## Review Questions\n\nLet's review the concepts we have learned in this lesson.\n\n1. What will be the result of the `alert` in the code below?\n\n```JavaScript\nvar myArray = [1, 2, 'dog', true, [1, 2, 3]];\nmyArray.pop();\nalert(myArray[4]);\n```\n\n\u003cQuiz\u003e\n- 1, 2, 3\n- true\n- undefined*\n\u003c/Quiz\u003e\n\n2.

What will be the result of the `alert` here?\n\n```JavaScript\nvar myArray = [1, 2, 'dog', true, [1, 2, 3]];\nmyArray.splice(0, 2);\nalert(myArray[0]);\n```\n\n\u003cQuiz\u003e\n- 1\n- 2\n- dog*\n- true\n- [1, 2, 3]\n\u003c/Quiz\u003e\n\n## Challenges\n\n1. Write a `for` loop that prints all even numbers from 0 to 100 to the console.\n\n2. The library program is very case sensitive, requiring the user to enter exact punctuation and capitalization of a book title. This is not a very robust search. Try improving the program using the [toLowerCase method](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_tolowercase.asp), which converts all the letters of a string to lowercase, to make the search parameters case insensitive. _Hint: To match the two terms, you will want to perform the `toLowerCase` method both on the user's response as well as on each book title in the library. Try storing these results in new variables!_\n\n## Key Terms\n\nDo you recall the following terms from this lesson?\n- `array`\n- `index`\n- `length`\n- `push`\n- `pop`\n- `splice`\n- `sort`\n- `indexOf`\n\n# Functions\n\nIn the last lesson, we learned how to loop through a series of statements to repeat blocks of code. As you saw, this can be very useful if we want to automate a series of tasks that would otherwise take forever to write out manually. __Functions__ are another technique that can be used to repeat and reuse blocks of code and help us automate tasks. In this lesson, we will learn how to create our own functions and how to use them. To this end, at the bottom of the lesson we will create a simple grading program that will allow you to add, calculate, and display student grades.\n\n## What are Functions?\n\nFunctions are blocks of code that are designed to perform a specific task and can be reused. When developing applications, you will likely need to perform the same action in many different places. For example, you may need to perform a specific calculation on a number of different values and in different places in your code. Or, you might want to show an error message whenever an error occurs. Instead of rewriting the same code over and over again to perform these actions, you can wrap the code in a function and then call the function whenever you need to perform the action.\n\nThe basic syntax for creating a function is as follows:\n\n```JavaScript\nfunction functionName(parameter1, parameter2, ...) {\n    // code to be executed\n    return value;\n}\n```\n\nTo create a function, you must first define the function name. Naming conventions for functions are [lower CamelCase](https://wiki.c2.com/?LowerCamelCase), in which the first word is lowercase and the following words begin with a capital letter. Next, you define the function's __parameters__ or __arguments__ within closed parentheses `()`. The parameters are the values that will be __passed__ into the function when it is called. Passing in parameters allows us to reuse the same function for different tasks, because we can pass in different values to the function each time we want to reuse it. The parameters are separated by commas. You can define as many parameters as you want.\n\nLike loops, you can see that functions use curly braces to define their contents. The contents of the function are the code that will be executed whenever the function is called.\n\nFor a procedure to be designated a function, it will also __return__ a value. In other words, a function takes some input, transforms that input somehow, and returns an output. \n\nTo make this all clearer, let's look at a basic example of a function. We will create a function called `add` that takes two numbers as parameters and returns the sum of the two numbers.\n\n```JavaScript\nfunction add(num1, num2) {\n    return num1 + num2;\n}\n```\nFirst we define the function `add()` with two parameters to pass in, `num1` and `num2`. To add the two numbers we can simply return `num1 + num2`. Note that we could also have defined a variable `sum` and then returned `sum`, like so:\n\n```JavaScript\nfunction add(num1, num2) {\n    var sum = num1 + num2;\n    return sum;\n}\n```\n\nThis is functionally the same result. The only difference is that we have created a new variable within the function to store the sum.\n\n## Calling a Function\n\nIf you were to run the code above, you would see that nothing happens. This is because we have not __called__ the function yet. To call a function, we simply use the function name followed by parentheses. The parentheses contain the values that will be passed into the function. Let's try calling the `add()` function with two number values:\n\n```JavaScript\nfunction add(num1, num2) {\n    return num1 + num2;\n}\n\nadd(1, 2);\n```\n\nTry running this code in the editor below.\n\n\u003cCodeEditor language='JavaScript'\u003e\n    \u003c/CodeEditor\u003e\n\nAs you can see, the result of the `add()` function above returns 3 to the console. This is because `add()` takes two numbers as parameters and returns the sum of the two numbers. In this case, `num1` is 1 and `num2` is 2. If you change the values of `num1` and `num2` to different numbers, the result will also change. Again, this allows us to reuse the `add()` function to perform the same calculation on different values.\n\nWe could also capture the result of the function in a variable and then work with that variable. For example:\n\n```JavaScript\nfunction add(num1, num2) {\n    var sum = num1 + num2;\n    return sum;\n}\n\nvar result = add(1, 2);\nalert(result);\n```\n\nHere we are calling the `add` function and storing the result of the function (the return value) in the variable `result`. We can then use the variable to perform whatever action we want.\n\n__Note:__ Make sure you are passing in the correct number of parameters when calling a function (at least for functions you have created yourself. Built-in functions inherent to JavaScript can behave a little differently, but don't worry about that right now). If you call the function with too few parameters or too many parameters, your function will likely either behave in unexpected ways or throw an error.\n\nIt is worth pointing out that you can also call a function with no parameters and also without an explicit `return` statement. For example, we can create a function called `alertHello` that will simply alert \"Hello!\" to the user.\n\n```JavaScript\nfunction alertHello() {\n    alert('Hello!');\n}\n\nalertHello();\n```\n\nRunning this code will alert \"Hello!\" to the user.\n\nNote that if your code does not have a return statement or if the content does not return a value, JavaScript functions will automatically return `undefined`.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```JavaScript\nfunction doNothing() {\n    // do nothing\n}\n\ndoNothing();\n```\n\nIf you type this code into the developer console in your browser, you will see that the function returns `undefined` because you have not provided it with any return value.\n\nOkay, now that we have some basic understanding of how functions operate, let's look at how they create new \"scopes\" in your code.\n\n## Scope\n\nWhen you create a function, it designates a new __scope__. Scope is the context in which a particular variable is accessible. In other words, it means where a variable can be available for use (read, manipulated, displayed, etc.) in your code. Depending on how and where you declare your variables, you can have different scopes.\n\n### Rethinking Variable Declarations: `var` vs. `let` and `const`\n\nSo far in this course, we have used the `var` keyword to declare variables. While this was the old standard way of declaring variables in JavaScript, in most modern usages it has been replaced by the `let` and `const` keywords. `const` in particular has become the new standard for declaring variables in JavaScript. While you can see that the syntax is the same...\n\n```JavaScript\nvar name = 'John';\nlet age = 30;\nconst isAdmin = true;\n```\n\n...the behavior of the keywords is different. From now on, __we will shift to using the `let` and `const` keywords in this course, and in particular, to using `const`.__ What, then, are the differences between these variable declarations?\n\nTo understand the differences between these declarations, we need to understand their scope. Let's understand the scope of each of these types and see why `let` and especially `const` are the new standard.\n\n### `var`\n\n`var` declarations can be \"globally\" and \"function/locally\" scoped. Global scope means that the variable is available for use anywhere throughout your code. Function scope means that the variable is available for use only within the function it is defined. When declared outside of a function, `var` is global and can be accessed anywhere in your code. When declared inside of a function, `var` is function-scoped and can only be accessed within the function. Take a look at the example below:\n\n```JavaScript\nvar greet = \"hi there\";\n\nfunction newFunction() {\n    var hello = \"hello\";\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, `greet` is globally scoped because it exists outside of the function, while `hello` is function scoped. These variables have different levels of access. To see what I mean, try running the code below in the editor:\n\n```JavaScript\nvar greet = \"hey hi\"\n\nfunction newFunction() {\n    var hello = \"hello\";\n}\n\nconsole.log(greet); // this would work\nconsole.log(hello); // but this will not\n```\n\n\u003cCodeEditor language='JavaScript'\u003e\n    \u003c/CodeEditor\u003e\n\nAs you can see, the console trips up at the `console.log(hello);` and throws a `ReferenceError`, which states that '`hello is not defined`. This is because `hello` is only available _inside_ of the function in which it was declared. If you try to access `hello` outside of the function, JavaScript can't find the variable declaration you are referring to. In contrast, `greet` will correctly log the value of `greet` because it is globally scoped.\n    \nYou have also seen how `var` declarations are mutable, insofar as they can be re-declared and reassigned. You can change the value of a `var` at any time:\n\n```JavaScript\n// re-declaration\nvar greet = \"hi there\";\nvar greet = \"hello there\";\n\n// reassignment\nvar greet = \"hi there\";\ngreet = \"hello there\";\n```\n\nWhile this can be useful in some circumstances, it is not recommended. Once your programs become more complex, you may find yourself accidentally re-declaring or reassigning variables without realizing it. This can cause unexpected behavior and can be a source of bugs. This is a large part of why we will use the `let` and `const` keywords in the future instead of `var`, so let's discuss each of those keywords next.\n\n## `let`\n\nIn contrast to `var`, `let` declarations are block-scoped. This means that the variable is only available within the block of code in which it is declared. As you have seen, a block is a section of code surrounded by curly braces. So, a variable declared inside of a block with `let` is only available within that block. Try running the code below in the editor:\n\n```JavaScript\nlet someValue = 1;\n\nif (someValue \u003e 0) {\n    let greet = \"hi there\";\n    console.log(greet); // this will successfully log \"hi there\"\n}\n\nconsole.log(someValue); // this will successfully log 1\nconsole.log(greet); // but this throws a ReferenceError\n```\n\n\u003cCodeEditor language='JavaScript'\u003e\n    \u003c/CodeEditor\u003e\n\nWe can see that using `greet` outside of its block (the curly braces where it was defined) returns an error. Again, this is because `greet` is only available inside of the block in which it was declared. By contrast, `someValue` is available to display because it was declared within its own block outside of the function.\n\nJust like with `var`, you can reassign the values of `let` variables at any time. However, unlike `var`, you cannot re-declare a `let` variable. So while this will work:\n\n```JavaScript\n// reassignment\nlet greet = \"hi there\";\ngreet = \"hello there\";\n```\n\nThis will not:\n\n```JavaScript\n// re-declaration, will error\nlet greet = \"hi there\";\nlet greet = \"hello there\";\n```\n\nIf you try running the re-declaration code you will get a `SyntaxError` that says `\"Identifier 'greet' has already been declared\"`. Using `let` therefore solves the problem of accidentally re-declaring variables. \n\n__Note:__ While you cannot re-declare a `let` variable within the block is which it was declared, you _can_ re-declare a `let` variable _outside_ of the block in which it was declared:\n\n```JavaScript\nlet greet = \"hi there\";\nif (true) {\n    let greet = \"hello there\";\n    console.log(greet); // this will successfully log \"hello there\"\n}\nconsole.log(greet); // will successfully log \"hi there\"\n```\n\nDo you understand why this works? Because they are block-scoped, both `greet` variables are treated as _entirely different_ variables!\n\nAs you can see, `let` is an improvement over `var` in the sense that it can help you avoid accidentally modifying the value of a variable that you did not intend to modify. However, `const` has become the standard for many cases, so let's look at why.\n\n## `const`\n\nIn the rest of this course, we will often use `const` to declare variables. Like `let`, `const` is block-scoped. This means that the variable is only available within the block of code in which it is declared. However, unlike `let`, `const` variables are __immutable__. This means that once they are declared, they cannot be updated or re-declared. As you might have guessed, `const` is shorthand for \"constant.\" In other words, `const` is a way to declare variables that you will never want to modify.\n\nThe value of a `const` variable always remains the same within its scope. So, if we declare a `const` variable, we can't do any of the following:\n\n```JavaScript\n// reassignment\nconst greet = \"hi there\";\ngreet = \"wait, say hello there instead\"; // throws a TypeError\n\n// re-declaration\nconst greet = \"hi there\";\nconst greet = \"I really wish I could say hello there\"; // throws a TypeError\n```\n\nRunning this code would give you a `TypeError` saying `\"Cannot assign to constant variable\"`. This is because we are trying to change the value of a constant variable.\n\nOkay, now that we have a basic understanding of how scope in JavaScript works, let's move on to utilizing functions to create a simple grading program.\n\n## The Student Grades Program\n\nUsing functions, let's create a simple program that will allow us to evaluate student grades.\n\nLet's imagine that students have just submitted several homework assignments and we need to evaluate their grades. We want to:\n1. Easily display their grades.\n2. A new student has joined and submitted work, so we want to add a student to our list of students.\n3. Evaluate their numbered grades to a letter (A, B, C, D, or F).\n\nFunctions are perfect for this because we can define each of these three tasks as a separate function. We can then call each of these functions at the appropriate time. Remember, functions should be used to perform a _single_ defined task whenever possible.\n\n## Objects\n\nFor this program, we first need a way to store the information about each student. We want to store the name of each student as well as their corresponding grades. While we could solely use arrays to accomplish this, it makes much more sense to utilize a new data type called __objects__. \n\nObjects are similar to arrays, but they are more flexible. Objects are collections of _key-value_ pairs, and each key-value pair is called a _property_. In real life, all objects have properties. For example, a car has properties such as `make`, `model`, `year`, `color`, and so on. Analogously, we might imagine that a student has properties such as `name`, `grade`, `GPA`, and so on.\n\nTo create an object, we use the curly brace `{}` syntax. For example, we could create a student object with the following code:\n\n```JavaScript\nlet student = {\n    name: \"Bob\",\n    grade: \"A\",\n    GPA: 4.0\n};\n```\n\nHere we have a student object with three properties: `name`, `grade`, and `GPA`. Each key is followed by a colon `:` and the corresponding value. We separate each key-value pair (each property) with commas.\n\nTo access the value of a property, we use the `.` syntax with the key. For example, to log the properties of our `student` object, we could write:\n\n```JavaScript\nconsole.log(student.name); // logs \"Bob\"\nconsole.log(student.grade); // logs \"A\"\nconsole.log(student.GPA); // logs 4.0\n```\n\nAs you can see, objects very usefully allow us to associate a number of different properties with a single item.\n\nFor our purposes, we have many students rather than just one. How might we accomplish this? Well, we can create an array of objects! Let's try creating an array of student objects.\n\n```JavaScript\nlet students = [\n    {\n        name: \"Bob\",\n        grades: [88, 90, 80, 77, 89]\n    },\n    {\n        name: \"Alice\",\n        grades: [100, 95, 92, 89, 97]\n    },\n    {\n        name: \"Juan\",\n        grades: [91, 90, 94, 86, 90]\n    }\n];\n```\n\nHere we have an array of three student objects. Each student object has a `name` property and a `grades` property. The `grades` property is itself an array of numbers (5 different grades).\n\n### Printing the Grades\n\nNext, let's write a function to print all student names and their grades. Because we want to iterate through the array of student objects, we will use a `for` loop.\n\n```JavaScript\n// print all student names and their grades\nfunction printGrades(students) {\n    for (let i = 0; i \u003c students.length; i++) {\n        console.log(students[i].name + \": \" + students[i].grades);\n    }\n}\n\nprintGrades(students);\n```\n\nAs you can see, we are accessing the `name` and `grades` properties of each student object (using the `.` dot operator) and logging them as we loop through.\n\n### Adding a Student\n\nA new student joined our class and submitted his work. So, let's add him to our array of students with a new `addStudent` function.\n\n```JavaScript\nfunction addStudent(name, grades) {\n    let student = {\n        name: name,\n        grades: grades\n    };\n    students.push(student);\n}\n\naddStudent(\"Biff\", [71, 80, 56, 65, 60]);\n```\n\nIn the function, we are creating a new student object with `name` and `grades` properties to match the other students. We then add this object to the end of the `students` array using the `push` method. Finally, we call the function with the name and grades of the new student (poor Biff didn't do too well, sadly), which will add the values to the corresponding properties. If you were to run the `printGrades` function now, you would see that the new student is included in the list of students.\n\n### Converting Grades to Letters\n\nLastly, let's create a function to convert all student grades to letter grades and print them: \n\n```JavaScript\nfunction convertGrades(students) {\n    for (let i = 0; i \u003c students.length; i++) {\n        let grades = students[i].grades;\n        let letterGrade = \"\";\n        for (let j = 0; j \u003c grades.length; j++) {\n            if (grades[j] \u003e= 90) {\n                letterGrade += \"A \";\n            } else if (grades[j] \u003e= 80) {\n                letterGrade += \"B \";\n            } else if (grades[j] \u003e= 70) {\n                letterGrade += \"C \";\n            } else if (grades[j] \u003e= 60) {\n                letterGrade += \"D \";\n            } else {\n                letterGrade += \"F \";\n            }\n        }\n        console.log(students[i].name + \": \" + letterGrade);\n    }\n}\n\nconvertGrades(students);\n```\n\nThis function is slightly more complicated, because we need to iterate _both_ through the `students` array and each student's `grades` array, and evaluate the latter numbers to a letter grade. We can accomplish this by using two `for` loops: a `for` loop to iterate through the `students` array (using `i` and `students.length`), and a nested `for` loop to iterate through each student's `grades` (using `j` and `grades.length`). In other words, as we work through each student object, we first store the grades values of each student in a variable `grades`. Because `grades` is itself an array of values, we can use the `.length` property to determine the number of grades for each student (5). We then use the `if` statement to determine the letter grade for each number, and add it to the `letterGrade` variable with the `+=` operator (and an extra space at the end to make it more readable).\n\nLet's put the whole program together:\n\n```JavaScript\n// array of student objects\nlet students = [\n    {\n        name: \"Bob\",\n        grades: [88, 90, 80, 77, 89]\n    },\n    {\n        name: \"Alice\",\n        grades: [100, 95, 92, 89, 97]\n    },\n    {\n        name: \"Juan\",\n        grades: [91, 90, 94, 86, 90]\n    }\n];\n\n// print all student names and their grades\nfunction printGrades(students) {\n    for (let i = 0; i \u003c students.length; i++) {\n        console.log(students[i].name + \": \" + students[i].grades);\n    }\n}\n\n//add a new student\nfunction addStudent(name, grades) {\n    let student = {\n        name: name,\n        grades: grades\n    };\n    students.push(student);\n}\n\n// convert grades to letters\nfunction convertGrades(students) {\n    for (let i = 0; i \u003c students.length; i++) {\n        let grades = students[i].grades;\n        let letterGrade = \"\";\n        for (let j = 0; j \u003c grades.length; j++) {\n            if (grades[j] \u003e= 90) {\n                letterGrade += \"A \";\n            } else if (grades[j] \u003e= 80) {\n                letterGrade += \"B \";\n            } else if (grades[j] \u003e= 70) {\n                letterGrade += \"C \";\n            } else if (grades[j] \u003e= 60) {\n                letterGrade += \"D \";\n            } else {\n                letterGrade += \"F \";\n            }\n        }\n        console.log(students[i].name + \": \" + letterGrade);\n    }\n}\n\n// call functions\naddStudent(\"Biff\", [71, 80, 56, 65, 60]);\nprintGrades(students);\nconvertGrades(students);\n```\nTry running the program below in the editor and seeing the result in the browser's developer console.\n\n\u003cCodeEditor language='JavaScript' \u003e\n     \u003c/CodeEditor\u003e\n\n*Congratulations*, you have now created a simple grading program utilizing functions!\n\nFunctions are a great way to keep your code organized and readable. They are mainly used to create reusable pieces of code that can be employed in multiple places in your program. Remember that functions should ideally always be used to perform a _single_ task, and that their names should be descriptive of the task they are performing.\n\n## Review Questions\n\nLet's review the concepts we have learned in this lesson.\n\n1.

Especially when you are first beginning, it is easy to create errors and to write code that acts erratically. In fact, we have already made a few mistakes (on purpose) in previous lessons to illustrate the problems that can arise when learning to write a new programming language. However, you should be aware that even the most seasoned professional programmers make mistakes as well. Coding can be a frustrating, laborious task at times, and dealing with errors and bugs is a constant process. However, I think you'll also find that coming up with creative ways to address issues that arise in your code can also be a great source of satisfaction.\n\nThankfully, programmers have developed many tools and strategies to help us deal with errors. In this lesson, we will cover a variety of tools, techniques, and strategies to help you write cleaner code, avoid common programming errors and pitfalls, and generally feel more confident in your ability to address problems.\n\nFirst, let's jump into some common error types and their causes.\n\n## Common Types of Errors\n\n### Syntax Errors\n\nYou may have noticed that JavaScript is a finnicky language. One errant `{` can cause your entire program to break. For all their usefulness, computers are not (yet) very good at discerning meaning or understanding implicit intentions. You must speak to them in a highly specific way for them to understand what you are trying to achieve. \n\nWhen writing JavaScript, the most common type of error to make is a __syntax error__. These errors arise when you fail to add or misspell an element of the language that is needed for the code to be understood. For instance, below is an example of a basic syntax error. Can you identify the error? Try running it in the code editor to see the result.\n\n```JavaScript\nconst oops = 12;\nif (oops == 12 {\n    alert(oops)\n}\n```\n\n\u003cCodeEditor language=\"JavaScript\"\u003e\n    \u003c/CodeEditor\u003e\n\nAs you can see, we get the message of `SyntaxError: Unexpected token '{'`. In other words, it is telling us that the first curly brace seems out of place. Why? Well, looking closely you'll notice that we did not close the parentheses `)` in the `if` statement, as JavaScript expected us to. Instead, it found a curly brace and didn't know what to do with it. \n\nWhen dealing with syntax errors, it is often best to use the error message JavaScript gives you to try and pinpoint where the error might be located. In this example, for instance, the curly brace _is_ where it should be, but is still described as \"unexpected.\" From this you can guess that you are likely missing something immediately before it.\n\nMany code editors nowadays (including VSCode, which we'll begin to work with in the next lesson) have built-in tools that will detect and alert you to syntactical mistakes you are making while writing your code. Syntax errors will inevitably happen, though, so when you see them arise make sure to take a careful look over what you've written for typos or missing elements.\n\n### Type Errors\n\n__Type errors__ are when you try to perform an operation on a value of the wrong type. For instance, below is an example of a type error. Can you identify what is causing the error? Try running it in the code editor to see the result.\n\n```JavaScript\nlet num = 1;\noops = num.toUpperCase();\nconsole.log(oops);\n```\n\n\u003cCodeEditor language=\"JavaScript\"\u003e\n    \u003c/CodeEditor\u003e\n\nIn this example, we are trying to use the `toUpperCase` method on a number. However, `toUpperCase` is only available for strings. Hence the `TypeError` message. \n\nThis error gives us a direct clue for how to fix our code. We would first need to convert the number to a string. For instance, we could use the `toString` method:\n\n```JavaScript \nlet num = 1;\nfixed = num.toString().toUpperCase();\nconsole.log(fixed);\n```\n\nHere we apply both the `toString` and `toUpperCase` methods to the number, which then allows us to use it as an uppercase string.\n\nIf, for whatever reason, you are ever in doubt about the particular type of a value, remember that you can use the `typeof` operator to check its type. This is a useful tool for debugging.\n\n### Reference Errors\n\nWhen your programs begin to get more complex, it is occasionally difficult to discern what particular scope you are working within. This can cause programs to throw a __Reference Error__. Take a look at the example below. Can you identify what is causing the error? Try running it in the code editor to see the result.\n\n```JavaScript\nlet someValue = 1;\n\nif (someValue \u003e 0) {\n    let oops = \"blah blah\";\n    console.log(oops);\n}\n\nconsole.log(someValue);\nconsole.log(oops); \n```\n\n\u003cCodeEditor language=\"JavaScript\"\u003e\n    \u003c/CodeEditor\u003e\n\n\nAs you can see, we receive the message of `ReferenceError: oops is not defined`. This is telling us that we are trying to use the `oops` variable out of the scope in which it was declared. Always be sure to check the scope of your variables before using them.\n\n## Logical Errors\n\n__Logical errors__ occur where your syntax is actually correct but the code is not producing what you intended. In other words, the program runs successfully, but gives \"incorrect\" results. These are often harder to fix than other types of errors, as there usually isn't an explicit error message to direct you to the source of the error.\n\nTake a look at this example. It is a perfectly valid and legal code snippet, but won't work as intended. Can you identify where it is going wrong? Try running it in the code editor to see the result.\n\n```JavaScript\nfunction getPassword(){\n  let correct = \"password\";\n  let guess = \"\";\n  while (guess == correct) {\n    guess = prompt(\"What is the password?\");\n  }\n  alert(\"You may enter.\");\n}\n\ngetPassword();\n```\n\n\u003cCodeEditor language=\"JavaScript\"\u003e\n    \u003c/CodeEditor\u003e\n\nAs you can see, this is not a very good password system. In fact, it lets everyone have access immediately! To correct this, we would need to change the `==` operator to `!=`, to make sure the `while` loop runs until the correct password is entered.\n\nThis is a fairly straightforward example, but for larger pieces of software logical errors can be much more complex and difficult to identify. Let's discuss some general strategies to help you deal with logical errors.\n\n## Strategies to Avoid Mistakes\n\nBelow are some general strategies and best practices you can follow to help you think through the structure and design of your programs.\n\n### Writing Pseudo-code\n\nOne common mistake for beginners in approaching code and coding problems is trying to solve a problem entirely in JavaScript. While this may seem like an obvious and commonsense approach, it is actually not always the best way to tackle a problem. Often, when creating complex programs, it is often useful to flesh out the structure and logic of your program before even writing any code or when faced with a seemingly unsolvable problem.\n\nThis practice is called __pseudo-coding__. Pseudo-code is an amalgamation of code-like expressions and regular English (or whatever natural language you are most comfortable with). There's no correct way to write pseudo-code--you make it up as you go along. As long as it looks a little bit like code and follows the same general pattern and procedure, you're doing well.\n\nThe reason we write pseudo-code is that it allows us to flesh out the logic of the program in a clear and accessible way. We use it to skip over unnecessary details in a way that we can easily convert into code later.\n\nHere's a possible example of pseudo-code for our simple password program from before:\n\n```\ncreate function get password\n    store correct password in variable\n    prompt user for password\n    while password is incorrect\n        prompt for password\n    alert user they may enter\n    end function\n```\n\nAs you can see, pseudo-code is a lot more readable than writing actual code. It provides you with an accessible blueprint of a program's logic and structure that you can then overlay or follow with actual code.\n\nAs mentioned, there is no one way to write pseudo-code. You can be as detailed or as abstract as you'd like. As long as you are clarifying the structure of your program to yourself (and others you may be collaborating with), it is sufficient. It is often best, however, to write pseudo-code that more or less matches the syntax and vocabulary of JavaScript.\n\nWhenever you are beginning a new program, it is highly recommended to write pseudo-code first. Not only will it make the overall structure of your program more intelligible, but it will also help you to avoid making logical errors down the road.\n\n### General Tips\n\nHere are some more general tips for dealing with logical errors:\n\n1. Understand what your code is doing step by step.\n\nWith a logical error, code behavior is unpredictable. A loop may never happen, it may never end, or it might sometimes work right and sometimes not. The key to finding logic errors is to predict why the code is doing what it's doing and why it's not doing what you want. Follow through your code step by step, identifying key changes of behavior. \n\n2. Form a hypothesis or two before looking at any code. \n\nThink about what is wrong before you look over the code. Try to describe in plain English what is going wrong. Go through this process before you look at code because the moment you see code, you'll start worrying about details rather than thinking about the bigger picture. Logic errors are almost always about logic, and no amount of staring at code will show you logic errors, nor will a debugger spot them for you.\n\n3. Resolve syntax errors.\n\nGo to the console and see if there are any syntax errors. If so, resolve them. Logic errors will not appear until you've resolved all syntax errors. If your code shows no syntax errors but still doesn't work correctly, you've got a logic error.\n\n4. Identify key variables or conditions.\n\nMost logic errors are centered around a condition that's not working right, and conditions are usually based on variables. Begin by taking a careful look at the conditions that control the behavior you're concerned about.\n\n5. Think about your logic.\n\nLogical errors aren't about getting the vocabulary right (remember, those are syntax errors). Logic errors are about telling the computer to do the wrong thing. The computer only does precisely what you tell it to do, so think hard about the logic you've applied and how you might be able to revise it.\n\n## Using console.log() to Debug\n\nTODO: emphasize console log debugging over printing\n\nTo keep things simple, we have been console.logging a lot of our programs just so we can see an immediate result. However, `console.log()` is best for debugging purposes\n\nWhen trying to fix problems in your code, it is often useful to use the `console.log()` function to print out the value of a variable or expression to see what you are actually getting\n\nTODO: Add how to read code from Python the hard way\n\n## Review Questions\n\n1. True or False - A syntax error occurs when code is not typed out correctly.\n\n\u003cQuiz\u003e\n- True*\n- False\n\u003c/Quiz\u003e\n\n2. True or False - A reference error occurs when a variable is used outside its scope or before it is declared.\n\n\u003cQuiz\u003e\n- True*\n- False\n\u003c/Quiz\u003e\n\n3. True or False - A logical error occurs when code works but is not producing the results you expected.\n\n\u003cQuiz\u003e\n- True*\n- False\n\u003c/Quiz\u003e\n\n## Challenges\n\n1. Identify the logical error in the following code.\n\n```JavaScript\n// find the even numbers in an array\nlet someValues = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\n\nfor (let i = 0; i \u003c someValues.length; i++) {\n    if (someValues[i] / 2 == 0) {\n        console.log(someValues[i]);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n2. Let's say you are writing a program that allows users to manage a collection of recipes. You want the user to be able to add, remove, edit, and search through their recipes. You also want the user to be able to \"favorite\" individual recipes and let them search and look through their list of favorites. Write some pseudo-code for a program that allows for each of these features.\n\n## Key Terms\n\n- syntax error\n- type error\n- reference error\n- logical error\n- pseudo-code\n\n# VSCode and GitHub \n\nUp to this point we have been working entirely in the browser and our work has faded into the past at every screen refresh. Ephemerality is not a feature much appreciated in programming. So, to get started on something more permanent, let's set up a practice folder to hold our code. Call it `javascript`, or whatever you want, as long as you promise to remember it. Throughout the rest of this course, we will be working in this folder. \n\nClick this button to download a couple of files we'll be needing. Unzip the folder and add the files to your working folder.\n\n\u003cDownload files='index.html, script.js'\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\n\nNext, we'll want to get our coding environment set up. This will be the main focus of this particular lesson. We'll first install the VSCode code editor, and then learn how to set up and use a GitHub repository.\n\nMuch of your academic career has likely been structured around sending in single documents. For instance, a .pdf or Word document of your latest essay masterpiece. In general, however, going forward in this class you'll want to think of your work in terms of a __project__, which is a collection of files and code that you want to work on. In the coding environment we'll set up and the project we'll create, we'll be working with many files that will all contribute to the same overall project. A website, for instance, is a project, made up of many different files. What we will end up building by the end of this course will all be housed in the same folder and will be managed though a single GitHub repository. This will hopefully make more sense once we get into it.\n\nFor now, let's go ahead and install VSCode.\n\n## VSCode\n\nVSCode is a free and open-source code editor that is available for Windows, Mac, and Linux. It is a great tool for developers to use when they are working on code. It supports syntax highlighting, code completion, has built-in GitHub integration, and has an large library of extensions that can be used to extend its functionality.\n\n### Installing VSCode\n\nNavigate to the [homepage of VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and download the appropriate version for your operating system (stable version).\n\n![VSCode homepage](/images/vscode_homepage.png)\n\nOnce it is installed, open up the application. On the left sidebar, you'll see a few different options. Let's look at three of them:\n\n![VSCode sidebar](/images/vs_code_sidebar.png)\n\n- The Explorer Window is the main window that you'll be working with. It is the main way to navigate through your project and to interact with files.\n- The Search Window is a window that you can use to search for files or words throughout your project.\n- The Source Control Window will allow you to manage your project's files and code through GitHub integration.\n\nThese are the main windows you'll be working with, along with the main code editor area, in which you'll be writing code.\n\n### Opening a Project\n\nFor now, go ahead and open up the Explorer Window and click Open Folder. Navigate to your working folder for the course, select the folder, and click Select Folder.\n\nIn the Explorer, you should now be able to view both the `index.html` file and the `script.js` file, and can open them to view the code for each file.\n\n![New Project](/images/vscode_openproject.png)\n\nNext, let's go ahead and initialize a Git repository for our project.\n\n## Creating a GitHub Account\n\nThe first step we'll need to take is to set up a GitHub account. Navigate to the [GitHub homepage](https://github.com/) and click \"Sign Up for GitHub\". You'll be prompted to create a new account.\n\n![GitHub Sign Up](/images/github_homepage.png)\n\n __Note:__ Although you don't have to, it is best to use your student email account (.edu) to register with GitHub, as this will allow you access to some features you otherwise would have to pay for.\n\n Work through the steps to create a new account and return here when you are finished.  \n\n## Getting Acquainted with Git and GitHub\n\nNow that you have a GitHub account, let's go ahead and initialize a repository (folder) for our project. \n\nFirst, we should understand a little about how Git and Github work. __Git__ is a _version control system_ that allows you to track changes to your files. If you have used \"track changes\" in the past with either Microsoft Word or Google Docs, you're likely familiar with the terminology. In effect, you are tracking all of the \"versions\" or life-histories of your files stored in the repository.\n\n__GitHub__ is an online platform for hosting Git repositories. It functions for some, predominantly programmers, as a social network for sharing and collaborating on code-based projects. Users can share their own projects, as well as search for others, which they can then often work on and contribute to. Digital Humanists, librarians, and other academics are also finding ways Git and GitHub are useful in writing projects and teaching.\n\nA [study of how Digital Humanists use GitHub](https://digitalscholarship.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/spirosmithdh2016githubpresentationfinal.pdf), conducted by Lisa Spiro and Sean Morey Smith, found that a wide range of users, including professors, research staff, graduate students, IT staff, and librarians commonly used the site in their DH work. They used GitHub for a diverse range of activities, such as:\n\n- Developing software\n- Sharing data sets\n- Creating websites\n- Writing articles and books\n- Collating online resources\n- Keeping research notes\n- Hosting syllabi and course materials\n\nAlthough it has many benefits, using Git and GitHub effectively does take a bit of practice. It is notorious for being a bit of a pain in the neck (leading to such websites as [Oh Shit, Git!](https://ohshitgit.com/)), but it is worth the effort.\n\n## Initializing a Git Repository on GitHub\n\nGit, as a version control system, can be enabled in a folder, and then used to save the state of the contents in that folder at different points in the future. It will also keep a record of all changes made in the past. It knows exactly when a file is added to a project and even when it is deleted. It can even resurrect files that have been deleted, if needed.\n\nLet's go ahead and initialize a Git repository for our project. In VSCode, click on the Source Control Window and click on the `Initialize Repository` button.\n\n![Initialize Repository](/images/vscode_initgit.png)\n\nYou should now be able to see the following:\n\n![Initial Commit](/images/vscode_gitcommit.png)\n\nIn Git, every change you make to a file and submit to version control is called a __commit__. A commit is effectively a snapshot of a file or files at a certain point in time. Every commit also has a __commit message__, which is a short description of what the commit is all about, either for yourself or for others you are collaborating with. You should write a brief, descriptive message that encapsulates the changes you have made at that point in time.\n\nLet's go ahead and make our first commit. In VSCode, type \"First commit\" in the message window and click `Commit`.\n\nYou should receive a message that `There are no staged changes to commit`. \n\n![No Staged Changes](/images/vscode_nostaged.png)\n\nThis is because we haven't made any changes to any files yet and because we haven't __staged__ any files yet. Before making a commit, you need to add the files to the \"staging environment\". Staged files are those that are ready to be committed. This will make more sense later as we continue to work with Git.\n\nFor now, go ahead and click `Yes` to the prompt.\n\nAfterwards, you should see a button updated to `Publish Branch`.\n\n![Publish Branch](/images/vscode_publishbranch.png)\n\nGo ahead and click Publish Branch. You should be prompted to sign into GitHub. Go ahead and click `Allow`, and sign in to GitHub with your account.\n\nIf you receive a message to `Authorize VSCode`, click Authorize.\n\n![Authorize VSCode](/images/github_authorize.png)\n\nIf you are given additional messages to allow VSCode to access your account, click through to allow.\n\nLastly, you will want to give your repository a name. In VSCode at the top, you should see a text field window for typing the name of your repository. Give it whatever name you want, and click `Publish to public repository`. You can also create private repositories, but for this class we will make our repositories public.\n\nAfterwards, you should see a message that says `Successfully published to GitHub` in the lower right corner of VSCode. (If you also receive a message to `periodically run git fetch`, you can just say no for now.)\n\n![Successfully Published](/images/github_published.png)\n\nIf you click through to `Open in GitHub`, you should be able to see the repository you just created, along with a message of your first commit.\n\n![New Repository](/images/github_new_repository.png)\n\nCongratulations! You have successfully created a new GitHub repository for this course.\n\nLet's go ahead and explore our files a bit, make a new change, and make a new commit to our repository.\n\n## Exploring our Files\n\nBack in VSCode, open up the Explorer Window and click on the `index.html` file. \n\n![index.html](/images/index_scrn.png)\n\nThis is an HTML file. It contains the code for the page that we will be working with. We will learn more about HTML in the next lesson.\n\nNow open the `script.js` file. As you can tell by the file extension (`.js`), this is a JavaScript file. It contains the code for the JavaScript that we will be working with.\n\nAs a project, each of these files is contributing to the webpage. We will learn more about how later, but for now let's look at the webpage in your browser.\n\nIn your file system, (not in VSCode), navigate to your folder containing these two files and double-click the `index.html` file to open it in your browser.\n\nYou should see the following:\n\n![Hey it worked!](/images/heyitworked.png)\n\nIf you reference both files in VSCode, you can see that text from each is being reflected on the webpage. In the HTML file, we are displaying `This is my project!`. In the JavaScript file, we are providing an alert that says `Hey it worked!`.\n\n### Making a Change\n\nWithout worrying about the HTML for now, let's change the `Hey it worked!` message to `My project is going to be awesome!`. Go ahead and make the change in your code editor.\n\nIf you save the file now, you should see a new change being registered in the source control window.\n\n![Second Commit](/images/second_commit.png)\n\nThe number 1 in the source control icon indicates that there is one file change. If you click on it, you can see that it is tracking all the changes made to the file. The little `M` next to the file name indicates that the file is modified. \n\n### Staging our Change\n\nYou can also see a `+` (plus) sign next to the file name, which allows you to __stage__ a change for commit. Go ahead and click it. You should now see a section that says `Staged Changes`.\n\n![Staged Changes](/images/staged_changes.png)\n\n### Committing our Change\n\nNow that we have staged our change, let's go ahead and commit our change. Be sure to type a message for the commit, like `Second Commit`.\n\n### Pushing our Changes to GitHub\n\nYou should now see a button that says `Sync Changes`. In the lingo of Git, this is called __pushing__ your changes. It is a way to send your changes to the remote repository on GitHub. Simply committing your changes will _not_ make the changes on your remote repository until you push them. Let's go ahead and click `Sync Changes` and click `Ok`to the prompt.\n\nIf you navigate to your repository in GitHub, you should see a new commit with the message `Second Commit`.\n\n![New Commit](/images/github_secondcommit.png)\n\nCongratulations! You have successfully pushed your changes to GitHub.\n\nUsing Git and GitHub might take a little getting used to, but it is a valuable resource for maintaining, sharing, and collaborating on projects. \n\nTo wrap up, keep in mind that the general process for working with Git is as follows:\n1. Make Changes\n2. Stage modified files\n3. Commit files with message\n4. Push to remote repository on GitHub\n\n## Review Questions\n\n1. A version control system like Git allows you to (select all that apply):\n\n\u003cQuiz\u003e\n- track changes to your files*\n- share your files and collaborate with others*\n- restore files you may have deleted on your own machine*\n- undo changes and revert to earlier versions*\n\u003c/Quiz\u003e\n\n2. True or False - You need to stage your files before committing them.\n\n\u003cQuiz\u003e\n- True*\n- False\n\u003c/Quiz\u003e\n\n3. True or False - If you commit your changes, they will be immediately reflected in your GitHub repository.\n\n\u003cQuiz\u003e\n- True\n- False*\n\u003c/Quiz\u003e\n\n## Challenge\n\nWe saw that both the HTML file and the JavaScript file are contributing to the creation of our project webpage. For this challenge, try changing the text that is displayed from the HTML page to whatever you'd like. Once you have made a change and see it reflected in the webpage, stage the change, commit it, and push it to GitHub with an appropriate message.\n\n## Key Terms\n\nDo you recall the meaning of the following terms?\n\n- Git\n- GitHub\n- stage\n- commit\n- push\n\n# HTML and CSS\n\nIn the last lesson we set up our project and created a repository on GitHub. Now that we have the environment set up and some files to work with, let's begin learning about writing HTML and CSS to modify a webpage. \n\nWe will be refreshing the page a lot, so the first thing I recommend doing is opening your `script.js` file in VSCode and commenting out `//` the alert that says `My project is going to be awesome!` so it doesn't become as much of an annoyance.\n\n```JavaScript\n// alert('My project is going to be awesome!');\n```\n\nTo start us off and provide some context for this lesson, let's understand a bit about how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript work together.\n\n## HTML, CSS, and JavaScript\n\n__HTML__ stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is the standard language used to define the _structure and content_ of a particular webpage. It allows you to add text, images, and other elements to a webpage, and to direct the overall layout of the webpage. For example, you can use HTML to add a header to your webpage, structure text in a series of paragraphs, add a table, a list of bullet points, and much, much more. \n\nHTML works in tandem with __CSS__, which defines the _style_ of a webpage. CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. While HTML directs the overall structure and content of a page, CSS is used to define the particular stylistic or aesthetic appearance of the page. For example, you can use CSS to define the color of text, the font, the size, the background color, the color of elements like buttons, and much more. While you could create a webpage entirely using HTML, it would ultimately be a boring, uninteresting webpage with a white background and black Times New Roman text.\n\nBoth HTML and CSS can also work in tandem with JavaScript files. While HTML and CSS direct the structure and style of a page, JavaScript allows you to add _functionality_ to a webpage. For example, you could use JavaScript to add a button that says \"Click Me!\" and when the button is clicked, it will display an alert that says \"Hey a button was clicked!\". In other words, whatever the user can interact with on a webpage is controlled by JavaScript.\n\nIt's worth noting that the three languages are intertwined, and that you can write CSS and JavaScript inside an HTML file. This will make more sense as we continue learning.\n\nIn general, just keep in mind that:\n- HTML provides the _structure_ of a webpage.\n- CSS provides the _style_ of a webpage.\n- JavaScript provides the _functionality_ of a webpage.\n\nWith this in mind, let's dive into the basics of HTML.\n\n## HTML\n\nSo far, we have one HTML file to work with in our project: `index.html`. You can tell it is an HTML file by the `.html` extension. The name of the file (index) is an industry standard, because web browsers tend to recognize the index.html page as the opening page to your website directory. See [here](https://www.thoughtco.com/index-html-page-3466505) for more explanation.\n\nLet's take a look at the contents of the file. Open your project in VSCode and open the `index.html` file. You should see the following code display:\n\n```html\n\u003c!doctype HTML\u003e\n\u003chtml lang=\"en\"\u003e\n  \u003chead\u003e\n    \u003cmeta charset=\"utf-8\"\u003e\n    \u003ctitle\u003eMy JavaScripting Master's Student Project\u003c/title\u003e\n  \u003c/head\u003e\n  \u003cbody\u003e\n    \u003ch1\u003eThis is my project!\u003c/h1\u003e\n    \u003cscript src=\"script.js\"\u003e\u003c/script\u003e\n  \u003c/body\u003e\n\u003c/html\u003e\n```\n\nThis is a standard layout for a basic HTML page. The first thing you'll probably notice is that HTML elements are defined by the `\u003c` and `\u003e` characters. Some tags need both opening and closing tags, like `\u003ch1\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e`, while others only need one tag, like `\u003cmeta\u003e`. Tags that are self-closing, or don't require closing tags, are called _void elements_. To close a tag when needed, add a `/` before the name of the element in the last tag.\n\nLet's break down some of the specific elements we are seeing here. The first element is a `\u003c!doctype\u003e` tag. This tag is used to define the type of document that is being created: in this case, an HTML doc. We also see an `\u003chtml\u003e` tag. This tag begins the HTML document proper.\n\nWe also have a `\u003chead\u003e` tag. This element is where we put all of the background information, or _metadata_, about the webpage. None of this information is actually visible in a webpage except for the `\u003ctitle\u003e` tag, which will be displayed as the title of the page in your browser's title bar.\n\nNext, we have the `\u003cbody\u003e` tag. This tag begins the body of the webpage, where we put all of the actual content we want to display. In this case, we have a `\u003ch1\u003e` tag. This tag defines a header, or a large series of text, and it has a text content of `\"This is my project!\"`. For the moment, let's skip the `\u003cscript\u003e` tag--we'll discuss that later in the lesson. We end the HTML document by closing the `\u003cbody\u003e` and `\u003chtml\u003e` tags.\n\nIn general, then, the basic template for any HTML document is as follows:\n\n```html\n\u003c!doctype HTML\u003e\n\u003chtml lang=\"en\"\u003e\n    \u003chead\u003e\n        \u003ctitle\u003eThis is the page title.\u003c/title\u003e\n    \u003c/head\u003e\n\u003cbody\u003e\n    \u003ch1\u003eHere's an example large heading.\u003c/h1\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003eThis is an example paragraph of text.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/body\u003e\n\u003c/html\u003e\n```\n\nIn other words...\n- All HTML documents must start with a document type declaration: `\u003c!doctype html\u003e`.\n- The HTML document itself begins with `\u003chtml\u003e` and ends with `\u003c/html\u003e`.\n- The `\u003chead\u003e` of the HTML document contains the metadata about the document, such as the `\u003ctitle\u003e`.\n- The visible part of the HTML document is between `\u003cbody\u003e` and `\u003c/body\u003e`, which can hold any number of elements you want to display.\n\n### Useful Tags\n\nThere are many tags you will find yourself using in HTML. Here are some of the most common:\n\n- `\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e`: This tag defines a paragraph of text.\n- `\u003ch1\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e`: This tag defines a header, or a large series of text.\n- `\u003ch2\u003c/h2\u003e`: This tag defines a smaller header, or a smaller series of text. It descends all the way down to `\u003ch6\u003e`.\n- `\u003cimg src =\"...\" alt=\"Text for accessibility purposes\" /\u003e`: This tag sets an image to display. Note that it is a void element, meaning that it doesn't have a closing tag.\n- `\u003ca href=\"...\"\u003e...\u003c/a\u003e`: This tag creates a hyperlink.\n- `\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e`:  This tag designates a container block or section for other elements.\n- `\u003csection\u003e\u003c/section\u003e`: This tag creates a section of content.\n\nThere are many, many other tags you will encounter in the wild. You can find a complete list of tags here: [HTML Tags](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/default.asp).\n\nIn your browser, you can observe the HTML for any page you encounter using the same browser's developer tools you used to open the console. It may not make much sense depending on the page you are looking at, but it can often be a good way to get a sense of what the HTML looks like. Open the `index.html` page in your browser and right-click on the page and select `View Source`. You should be familiar with the code you are seeing.\n\n### HTML Attributes\n\nIn the `\u003chtml\u003e` tag in our `index.html` file, you'll also notice we have added `lang=\"en\"`. This is called an _attribute_. Attributes are pieces of information that are added to a tag element, and follow the syntax `attribute=\"value\"`. They allow us to modify the behavior of the element in a variety of ways or to add information. Here we wrote `lang=\"en\"` to define the language of the document as English (a common practice as info for the browser). \n\nYou'll also notice, in the `\u003cscript\u003e` tag, that we added a `src` attribute. We'll discuss this in more detail later in this lesson. Throughout the course, you'll be introduced to a variety of useful attributes that you can use to modify elements in your HTML pages. For now, however, just keep in mind the syntax so you can recognize attributes when you see them.\n\nNow that we have some basic understanding of how an HTML document is set up, let's move on to CSS to add some style to our webpage.\n\n## CSS\n\nAs mentioned earlier, HTML works in conjunction with CSS to define the style of a webpage. \n\nExamples of what CSS can help you modify include:\n- What background color you want to use for the page or a paragraph.\n- What font or font size you want for your headings or your normal text.\n- How large you want the images, and whether you want them aligned center, left, or right.\n- Where elements appear on the page.\n- Whether elements are visible to a user or not.\n\nAnd much more! \n\n### Adding A New Stylesheet\n\nCSS files are called _stylesheets_. Let's create a new file called `style.css` in our project so we can modify the style of our HTML page. The useful thing about stylesheets is that we simply need to create _one_, which will then control the layout of many different HTML documents.\n\nTo add a new file in VSCode, simply click on the \"New File\" button  next to your project title in the Explorer window. Type `styles.css` into the name field and hit \u003ckbd\u003eEnter\u003c/kbd\u003e. Make sure to add the `.css` extension to the name.\n\nNext, we'll link to the `style.css` file in our HTML file so it can be applied to our webpage. In our HTML file, we'll connect the files through a void `\u003clink\u003e` tag that lives inside the _parent_, or containing, `\u003chead\u003e` tag. Its `href` attribute is a relative link to our CSS document. The link tag is as follows:\n\n```html\n\u003clink rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"styles.css\"\u003e\n```\n\nThe `rel` attribute is used to define the relationship between the HTML document and the CSS document. In this case, the relationship is `stylesheet` because we are linking a CSS stylesheet. The `href` attribute is used to define the location of the CSS document. In this case, the location is relative to the location of the HTML document (it lives in the same folder), so we'll just provide the name of the CSS file.\n\nSo, open the `index.html` file in VSCode and add the `\u003clink\u003e` to the `\u003chead\u003e` section like so:\n\n```html\n\u003c!doctype HTML\u003e\n\u003chtml lang=\"en\"\u003e\n  \u003chead\u003e\n    \u003cmeta charset=\"utf-8\"\u003e\n    \u003clink rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"styles.css\"\u003e\n    \u003ctitle\u003eMy JavaScripting Master's Student Project\u003c/title\u003e\n  \u003c/head\u003e\n  \u003cbody\u003e\n    \u003ch1\u003eThis is my project!\u003c/h1\u003e\n    \u003cscript src=\"script.js\"\u003e\u003c/script\u003e\n  \u003c/body\u003e\n\u003c/html\u003e\n```\n\n### Styling Elements\n\nNext, let's start adding some styling to our page. In the `styles.css` file, let's add a background color. We'll do this by adding a `background-color` property to the `body` element. \n\n```css\nbody {\n    background-color: rgb(118, 92, 120);\n  }\n``` \n\nTo modify an HTML element, you first indicate which element you want to modify, followed by curly braces containing the properties you want to modify. In this case, we want to modify the `background-color` of the `body` element. Lines within the curly braces are called _declarations_, and they change the formatting of the elements in the HTML document. Each line in the declaration sets the value for a property and ends with a semicolon `;`.\n\nTo define the color, we use the `rgb()` function. This function takes three numbers as arguments that represent color values, and returns a color in the form `rgb(Red, Green, Blue)`. In this case, I'm using the RGB values for a purplish gray color, but you can use whatever color you'd like. VSCode usually comes equipped with a built-in color picker, so you can just click on the color you want and it will appear in the text field. If you can't see the color picker, you can also determine particular RGB values using [this online resource](https://htmlcolorcodes.com/color-picker/) to get the RGB value you want along with analogous colors. \n\n__Note:__ High contrast is very important for people with vision problems. So, when designing websites always ensure that the contrast between the text color and the background color (or background image) is good!\n\nIf you save the CSS file and open the HTML file in your browser, you should now see the background color change.\n\nNext, let's modify the header element a bit. Let's make it white, a different font, and a little bigger. We'll also set it to be bold and center it.\n\n```css\nh1 {\n    color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\n    font-size: 50px;\n    font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif;\n    font-weight: bold;\n    text-align: center;\n  }\n```\n\nAs you can see, each of these aspects have their own properties you can modify. If you add this code to your file and refresh your browser, you should see the header centered and modified accordingly.\n\nNext, let's add a paragraph with some text to our page. We'll start by adding a `\u003cp\u003e` tag to our HTML file, within the `\u003cbody\u003e`. I'm going to add a very bad (sorry!) joke to my site, but you can write whatever you'd like.\n\n```html\n\u003c!doctype HTML\u003e\n\u003chtml lang=\"en\"\u003e\n  \u003chead\u003e\n    \u003cmeta charset=\"utf-8\"\u003e\n    \u003clink rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"styles.css\"\u003e\n    \u003ctitle\u003eMy JavaScripting Master's Student Project\u003c/title\u003e\n  \u003c/head\u003e\n  \u003cbody\u003e\n    \u003ch1\u003eThis is my project!\u003c/h1\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003eQ: Why did the programmer quit her job?\n      A: Because she didn't get arrays.\u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003cscript src=\"script.js\"\u003e\u003c/script\u003e\n  \u003c/body\u003e\n\u003c/html\u003e\n```\n\nNext, let's add some styling to the paragraph. We'll follow the same process as we did for the header, but we'll make the text size a bit smaller (20px smaller, to be precise).\n\n```css\np {\n    color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\n    font-size: 30px;\n    text-align: center;\n    font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif;\n    white-space: pre-line;\n  }\n```\n\nThe other addition is the `white-space` property. This property allows you to control how whitespace is handled. In this case, I wanted to preserve the line break in the text so the question and answer are on different lines, so I set the value to `pre-line`.\n\nIf you save and reload, you should see something like the following:\n\n![First CSS styling](/images/1_css-styling.png)\n\n### CSS Selectors\n\nCSS is made up of selectors with specific properties. Selectors are usually tags, ids, or classes. Let's take a look at both of the latter selectors. `id` will allow us to select a single element by its id and modify it. `class` will allow us to efficiently modify a number of elements with the same class at once.\n\n#### Class\n\nIn our project page so far, we applied many of the same styles to the `\u003ch1\u003e` element as well as to the `\u003cp\u003e` element. For instance, we centered them both, made them both white, changed the font, etc. This works, but is ultimately repetitive and inefficient because we had to rewrite the same code. Using the `\u003cdiv\u003e` tag and classes, we can make this much easier.\n\nFirst, let's create a class in our CSS file. We'll create a class called `formatText` and use it to style all the text on the page.\n\n```css\n.formatText {\n    color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\n    text-align: center;\n    font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif;\n    white-space: pre-line;\n  }\n```\n\nTo create a class, we use the `.` (dot) character followed by the name of the class. We can then use the class in our HTML file. Let's use the `\u003cdiv\u003e` tag, which acts like a container for other elements, and style it with our class. Everything within the `\u003cdiv\u003e` tag will then be styled according to the `.formatText` properties.\n\n\n```html\n\u003c!doctype HTML\u003e\n\u003chtml lang=\"en\"\u003e\n  \u003chead\u003e\n    \u003cmeta charset=\"utf-8\"\u003e\n    \u003clink rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"styles.css\"\u003e\n    \u003ctitle\u003eMy JavaScripting Master's Student Project\u003c/title\u003e\n  \u003c/head\u003e\n  \u003cbody\u003e\n    \u003cdiv class=\"formatText\"\u003e\n      \u003ch1\u003eThis is my project!\u003c/h1\u003e\n      \u003cp\u003eQ: Why did the programmer quit her job?\n        A: Because she didn't get arrays.\u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003c/div\u003e\n    \u003cscript src=\"script.js\"\u003e\u003c/script\u003e\n  \u003c/body\u003e\n\u003c/html\u003e\n```\n\nAs you can see, we use the `class` selector to style the `\u003cdiv\u003e` element with the name of the class we created. We include both text elements within the bounds of the `\u003cdiv\u003e` tag so they are both styled the same.\n\nBack in our CSS file, we can now delete the repetitive bits. Our `\u003ch1\u003e` element now only needs to be distinguished by font size and boldness...\n\n```css\nh1 {\n    font-size: 50px;\n    font-weight: bold;\n  }\n```\n\n...while our `\u003cp\u003e` element only needs to be distinguished by the text size.\n\n```css\np {\n    font-size: 30px;\n  }\n```\n\nAll together, your CSS file should now look something like this:\n\n```css\nbody {\n    background-color: rgb(118, 92, 120);\n  }\n\nh1 {\n    font-size: 50px;\n    font-weight: bold;\n  }\n\np {\n    font-size: 30px;\n  }\n\n.formatText {\n    color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\n    text-align: center;\n    font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif;\n    white-space: pre-line;\n  }\n```\n\nSave and reload the page, and you should see the same result as before. What, then, was the point? Well, by using classes we have reduced the amount of code we need to write and made it much more readable and organized. Classes are very useful when you know you want to style many elements at once with a number of common or generic properties. You can apply classes to almost any element, and every element can even have multiple classes! Just separate the names with a space, like so:\n\n```html\n\u003cdiv class=\"firstClass secondClass thirdClass\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n```\n\nThis is a particularly powerful feature of classes.\n\n##### ID\n\nIn contrast to classes, IDs are unique. They are used to identify a _single_ element in the HTML file rather than many. This is useful when you want to style a single element, but you don't want to style every element with the same properties.\n\nLet's say we wanted to set our joke apart from the header text a bit. Let's add a border around the joke text and provide it with a different background and font color. Let's also add a second joke to the page.\n\nThere are several ways we could do this, but the best might be to use a _flexbox_. Flexbox is a method to lay out elements in a way that is more efficient than using absolute positioning (or manually figuring out height, width, and dimensions of the page). It is a way to allow for a dynamic positioning of elements on a particular page. This layout also makes elements responsive, which means that the elements change their behavior according to the kind of device displaying them. No matter if you are viewing the page on a mobile phone or a computer monitor, the elements will be provided with appropriate position and symmetry. In general, flexbox is one of the best methods for vertically and horizontally centering elements because it’s responsive and doesn’t require margin calculations.\n\nLet's start by creating a new section in our HTML file, and adding a new `id` of `joke` to designate it as the joke section. I'll also add a new bad joke, this time at the expense of academics:\n\n```html\n\u003c!doctype HTML\u003e\n\u003chtml lang=\"en\"\u003e\n  \u003chead\u003e\n    \u003cmeta charset=\"utf-8\"\u003e\n    \u003clink rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"styles.css\"\u003e\n    \u003ctitle\u003eMy JavaScripting Master's Student Project\u003c/title\u003e\n  \u003c/head\u003e\n  \u003cbody\u003e\n    \u003cdiv class=\"formatText\"\u003e\n      \u003ch1\u003eThis is my project!\u003c/h1\u003e\n        \u003csection id=\"joke\"\u003e     \n          \u003cp\u003eQ: Why did the programmer quit her job?\n          A: Because she didn't get arrays.\u003c/p\u003e\n          \u003cp\u003eQ: What's the difference between an academic and a genie?\n          A: One grants wishes, the other wishes for grants.\u003c/p\u003e\n        \u003c/section\u003e\n    \u003c/div\u003e\n    \u003cscript src=\"script.js\"\u003e\u003c/script\u003e\n  \u003c/body\u003e\n\u003c/html\u003e\n```\n\nYou can see that we have now designated a new `\u003csection\u003e` with an `id` of `joke`. Next, let's move to our CSS file to define the properties for the section.\n\nThe syntax for ids is mostly the same as classes, but instead of using the `.` (dot) character, we use the `#` (hash) character:\n\n```css\n#joke {\n    border: 5px solid rgb(16, 29, 55);\n    background-color: rgb(118, 125, 158);\n    display: flex;\n    flex-direction: column;\n    justify-content: center;\n    align-items: center;\n    width: 50%;\n    margin: 0 auto;\n    color: rgb(255, 230, 204);\n  }\n```\n\nWe have several new things here, so let's break them down. First, we create a border around the joke text. We use the `border` property to set the border width (`5px` = 5 pixels) and style. `solid` indicates a solid fill border, and we set the color to a dark blue. We also use the `display` property to set the display type of our `joke` id to `flex`. This is defining our flexbox layout. We use the `flex-direction` property to set the direction of the layout to `column`. Flexboxes can utilize horizontal rows (this is defining their \"direction\") as well as a columnar structure. Choosing columns allows us to place jokes one below the other on our page and make it easier to read. In other words, each `\u003cp\u003e` element within the joke `\u003csection\u003e` will appear evenly spaced below the first as a long column of jokes.\n\n We then use the `justify-content` and `align-items` properties to set the alignment of the elements to `center`. This means that the elements (the jokes) will be aligned in the center of the flex container. We use the `width` property to set the width of the overall flex container to 50% of the width of the screen, and we use the `margin` property to set the margin to `0 auto`. This means that the container will be centered on the screen (the margins will be even on each side and it will warp to 50% of the screen width). Finally, we use the `color` property to set the text color to a light peach color.\n\n If you save and reload the page, you should now see something like the following:\n\n![joke id](/images/2_css-styling.png)\n\nNice! You'll notice that even though the id is located within the `.formatText` class (i.e., the parent class) and that its styling is still being applied, you can nest ids and classes within each other to override the styling of the parent or container they are in. This allows you to create a complex hierarchy of styles that can be applied to many elements at once.\n\nBy creating a joke id we now have a specific section to hold and style all our terrible jokes. At this point I might encourage you to check out the [flexbox guide here](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) to learn a bit more about flexboxes, as they are incredibly useful for modern CSS.\n\nAdditionally, while there are far, far too many CSS properties to cover in this course, I also urge you to at least peek through the [entire CSS reference library](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference) and bookmark it. Try looking up the `flex` property, or any of the other properties we have used so far.\n\n### External, Internal, and Inline CSS\n\nAs a final note about CSS, in this course we are using an _external_ CSS file, meaning it is its own separate file that we have to link to in our HTML. This is the recommended way to utilize CSS. However, it is possible to use CSS directly in your HTML file as well, through both _internal_ and _inline_ methods. If you are curious, you can visit [this page to understand the differences](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_howto.asp) between these methods. In general, however, just keep in mind that using external CSS files is the preferred method of using CSS.\n\n## JavaScript\n\nSo far, we have just been using HTML and CSS to style our page. The only bit of JavaScript we have is linked through the `\u003cscript\u003e` tag, located in the `\u003cbody\u003e` of the HTML file:\n\n```html\n    \u003cscript src=\"script.js\"\u003e\u003c/script\u003e\n```\n\nThe `src` (source) attribute is used to link to the JavaScript file `script.js`. This is the file that contains the code that will be executed when the page loads. At the moment, the only thing it is doing is alerting the user that your project is going to be awesome.\n\nIn the next lesson, we will learn how to use JavaScript to create a more complex webpage with some actual interactivity. For now, let's just review some of the concepts we've learned soWEll far concerning HTML and CSS.\n\n## Review Questions\n\n1. How do we associate a CSS stylesheet with a HTML file?

This might be a little confusing and disorienting at first, but with a bit of practice it will eventually begin to feel more natural.\n\nBefore we get to working with JavaScript, there are a few things we'll want to do. The first is to get a local server up and running so we can test our code on the fly, and the next will be to incorporate the jQuery library into our code. Let's accomplish these now.\n\n## Running a Live Server in VSCode\n\nSo far, we have simply double-clicked the `index.html` file in your computer's file system and opened it in the browser. This is a perfectly fine way to get started previewing our webpage, but it may cause issues as we add more complexity. To address this, let's add an extension to our VSCode that will allow us to run a local web server to load and preview our webpage.\n\nOpen up your project in VSCode. Next, click on the Extensions button in the sidebar.\n\n![vscode extension](/images/open_extensions.png)\n\nIn the search field, type `live server` and press enter.\n\nOpen the Live Server extension (it will likely be the first search result, see below for specifics), and click Install.\n\n![Live Server](/images/live_server.png)\n\nOnce installed, you should see a new button in the taskbar on the bottom-right of VSCode that says \"Go Live\".\n\n![Go Live](/images/go_live.png)\n\nClicking this button will open a new window that will load your webpage in the browser. Now, you can make changes to your page and, after saving the file in VScode, you can see your changes immediately reflected in the browser. Try changing some of the text on your page, saving it, and returning to your page in the browser. You should see your changes display, without even needing to reload the page. \n\nPretty neat, right?\n\nTo shut down the server, simply click on the button (now showing the port #) in the taskbar again.\n\n## Importing jQuery\n\nNext, we will incorporate the __jQuery library__ into our code. JQuery is an open-source JavaScript library that allows us to build our webpage without needing to reinvent the wheel in terms of common functionality. It takes many of the typical tasks that would usually take many lines of JavaScript or HTML code to accomplish, and simplifies them into functions that you can call with a single line of code. In short, it is a \"library\" in the sense that it provides us with many pre-written functions that we can use to make our webpage writing much more simple and efficient.\n\nFirst, we need to import the jQuery library into our code. To do this, we need to add another script tag to our HTML file. Above the `script.js` import in the `\u003cbody\u003e`, add the following line:\n\n```html\n\u003cscript src=\"https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.6.0.min.js\"\u003e\u003c/script\u003e\n```\n\nHere we are importing the jQuery library from the [jQuery CDN](https://code.jquery.com/) (Content Delivery Network). In other words, our `src` attribute is directed to the web server `code.jquery.com` and is told to download the source file `jquery-3.6.0.min.js`, which is the latest version of jQuery (at the time of writing this).\n\nNext, let's learn how to use jQuery to perform some basic tasks.\n\n## Using jQuery\n\n### Selecting Elements\n\nThe first function we will cover is the __jQuery selector__, which is one of the most important functions in jQuery. It allows us to select and manipulate HTML elements on our page. It is used to \"find\" HTML elements based on their name, id, class, type, and other attributes.\n\nAll selectors start with a dollar sign followed by parentheses: `$(\"\")`. A selector takes a single argument in the parentheses (set between doublequotes `\"\"`), which is the element we want to modify. Let's look at some basic examples.\n\n### Selecting the Header\n\nCurrently, our header in the `\u003ch1\u003e` tag seems a bit unnecessary. All it is doing is telling us `This is my project!`, which is information we clearly already know (and which also doesn't do much for the visitor to the site). We could, of course, simply change the text to something more appropriate, but to show you the power of jQuery selectors, let's play around with this element a bit and see how we can use JavaScript to modify it.\n\nFirst, we could simply hide the header from our page so that visitors to the site would not see it. In your `script.js`, add the following line:\n\n```JavaScript\n$(\"h1\").hide();\n```\n\nWe begin by selecting `$` the `h1` element of our page, and then we use the `.hide()` method to hide the element. This will remove the header from view on our page, but keep it in our HTML code. Save the file and check out your page in the browser. The header with the message `This is my project!` should now be hidden from view.\n\nWhat happens now if we add a new header to replace the old one? Let's try it out. In your `index.html`, add a new header below the old one:\n\n```html\n\u003ch1\u003eThis is my project!\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003ch1\u003eBad Jokes Galore!\u003c/h1\u003e\n```\n\nSave the file and check out your page in the browser. What happens?\n\nNothing, right? The new header is not visible to the visitor either. This is because by using the `$(\"h1\")` selector to hide, we are selecting _all_ the `h1` elements in our page. In other words, any `\u003ch1\u003e` tag we try to add will be hidden from view.\n\n### Selecting by ID\n\nLet's address this by utilizing an __ID selector__ instead. This will allow us to select a single element. In your `index.html`, let's define an id `noShow` for the header we specifically want to hide, like so:\n\n```html\n\u003ch1 id=\"noShow\"\u003eThis is my project!\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003ch1\u003eBad Jokes Galore!\u003c/h1\u003e\n```\nNext, let's change our selector so that only the element with the id `noShow` is hidden instead of all `h1` elements. In your `script.js`, change the hide code to the following:\n\n```JavaScript\n$(\"#noShow\").hide();\n```\n\nTo select by id, we use the `#` (hashtag) symbol followed by the id name (this is, as you might recall, the same when styling by id in CSS). If you save and view the page, you should now see the old header hidden from view, but the new header still visible:\n\n![id selector](/images/id_selector.png)\n\nGreat!\n\n...well, perhaps we think these jokes are getting too much flak. In fact, let's consider that these may actually be the best jokes ever. Why don't we change the text of the header to reflect this more positive attitude (no matter how misguided it may be)? We could, of course, simply change the text manually in the HTML file, but we can also use the `.html()` method to change the text of an element entirely in JavaScript.\n\nIn your `script.js`, add the following line:\n\n```JavaScript\n$(\"h1\").html(\"The Best Jokes Ever!\");\n```\n\nIf you save and check your page, you should now see the header text changed to `The Best Jokes Ever!`. \n\n![change header](/images/change_header_text.png)\n\nKeep in mind, again, that because we are specifying the `h1` tag, this will change the text of _all_ `h1` elements in the page to \"The Best Jokes Ever!\" If you were to add another header anywhere on the page, it would also change the text to \"The Best Jokes Ever!\". This is clunky and wouldn't be advised for more complex webpages, but will work for now just for demonstration purposes.\n\n### Selecting by Class\n\nSelecting by class is the same as selecting by id, but instead of using the `#` symbol, we use the `.` (dot) symbol. You can select any class element with the following syntax:\n\n```JavaScript\n$(\".className\")\n```\n\nThis will allow you to modify or manipulate all elements with the class `className` in the page, just as you did with the id selector.\n\n### Appending Elements\n\nLet's say we wanted to add a new joke to our page. We could simply add a new `\u003cp\u003e` tag to our HTML file like we did in earlier lessons, but we can also add elements with jQuery. It makes sense to use JavaScript here anyway--for instance, what if we wanted users to be able to post their own jokes to the page? We would want a way to automatically update the list of jokes rather than doing it manually ourselves. \n\nSo, let's use the `.append()` method to add a new joke to our `joke` section. In your `script.js`, add the following line:\n\n```JavaScript\n$(\"#joke\").append(\"\u003cp\u003eQ. What do you call a fake noodle? \u003cbr /\u003e A. An impasta\u003c/p\u003e\");\n```\n\nHere we are identifying the element with the id `joke` (used for our joke `\u003csection\u003e`) and adding a new paragraph `\u003cp\u003e` element to it. To keep a line break between the question and answer, we use the self-closing HTML `\u003cbr /\u003e` (break) tag in between. Save the file and check out your page in the browser.\n\n![append joke](/images/append_joke.png)\n\nCool, we now have three ~~terrible~~ amazing jokes on our page.\n\nTo wrap up, keep in mind that...\n- `$(\"\")` is the jQuery selector.\n- To select an element by id, use `#` followed by the id name.\n- To select an element by class, use `.` followed by the class name.\n- You can use methods like `.hide()` and `.html()` and `.append()` to modify elements that you select. \n\n## Adding Interactivity\n\nOkay, we have learned how to use jQuery to select and manipulate elements on our page. However, we still don't have any real interactivity. As a basic example, let's add a button that will allow us to show and hide the jokes section from view on the page.\n\n### Creating a Button\n\nTo create the button, add the following code to your `index.html` file, underneath your header tags:\n\n```html\n\u003cbutton id=\"toggleJokes\"\u003eToggle Jokes\u003c/button\u003e\n```\n\nHere we have a simple `\u003cbutton\u003e` element set to an id `toggleJokes`. If you save your file, you should now see a basic button on the page above your jokes section.\n\nYou can see that it doesn't look very good at the moment, so why don't we add a bit of styling to make it better? Now, we could simply style the button in our CSS file like we did with other elements in the page. For example, to make the button orange, with larger white text, a border, some padding, and some margin space around the button to separate it from other elements, we could add the following code to our `style.css` file:\n\n```css\n#toggleJokes {\n    background-color: orange;\n    color: white;\n    font-size: 20px;\n    border: 1px solid white;\n    border-radius: 5px;\n    padding: 10px;\n    margin: 10px;\n}\n```\n\nHere we are styling the button with the id `toggleJokes` using the CSS styling techniques we learned about earlier. This would probably be the best and most efficient way to style the button. However, you can also style an element entirely in JavaScript. Why don't we try this instead?\n\n### CSS Styling in JavaScript\n\nWe can use the `.css()` method to add styling to any element. For example, take a look at the code below:\n\n```JavaScript\n// modify css styles for the button\n$(\"#toggleJokes\").css(\"background-color\", \"orange\");\n$(\"#toggleJokes\").css(\"color\", \"white\");\n$(\"#toggleJokes\").css(\"font-size\", \"20px\");\n$(\"#toggleJokes\").css(\"padding\", \"10px\");\n$(\"#toggleJokes\").css(\"border-radius\", \"5px\");\n$(\"#toggleJokes\").css(\"border\", \"2px solid black\");\n$(\"#toggleJokes\").css(\"margin\", \"10px\");\n```\n\nHere, we are modifying the the many CSS properties of the button with the id `toggleJokes`. When using the `.css()` method, you must specify the property name and the value you want to set it to. As you can see, we use the same properties and values as we do when writing regular CSS styles. JavaScript, HTML, and CSS are very interwoven languages.\n\nInstead of writing a bunch of separate lines, we can also use the `.css()` method to modify the styles of multiple properties of an element at once. To do so, you simply wrap the properties in curly braces and separate them with a comma, writing them out as you would in a typical CSS style sheet:\n\n```JavaScript\n// modify css styles for the button\n$(\"#toggleJokes\").css({\n    \"background-color\": \"orange\",\n    \"color\": \"white\",\n    \"font-size\": \"20px\",\n    \"padding\": \"10px\",\n    \"border-radius\": \"5px\",\n    \"border\": \"2px solid black\",\n    \"margin\": \"10px\"\n});\n```\n\nThis is functionally the same, but is cleaner and easier to read. Add this code to your `script.js` file and save your file. You should see something like the following:\n\n![Button Styling](/images/style_button.png)\n\nA bit ugly still, but at least it has some flavor. Again, while it is preferred to define your styles within your CSS stylesheet, you can see how JavaScript can add dynamic styles to your elements as well. This can be useful when you have many different user actions going on.\n\nSpeaking of user actions, if you try clicking on the button, you'll notice it doesn't do anything yet. Let's add some proper interactivity to it.\n\n### Making the Button Clickable\n\nWe'll want this button to both show and hide the jokes section. Now, we could write a somewhat complex function that would `hide()` the jokes section when the button is clicked (and when the text is displayed), while also `show()` the jokes section when the button is clicked (when the text is hidden), but here's an example of jQuery to the rescue, simplifying things for us. You can simply use the `.toggle()` method to toggle the display (visible/invisible) of a particular element.\n\nTo accomplish this, however, we need to make the button clickable in the first place. We can do this by using another jQuery method, `.click()`, which will add a click __event__ to the button. You can think of events as \"things that happen\" to your HTML elements (text fields being typed in, buttons being clicked, etc). So, in your `script.js`, add the following lines:\n\n```JavaScript\n$(\"#toggleJokes\").click(function() {\n  $(\"#joke\").toggle();\n});\n```\n\nFirst we select the button with the id `toggleJokes` and then add a click event to it. We attach a simple function to the `click()` event so it will run when the click occurs. This function selects the `joke` section and adds a `.toggle()` method to it.\n\nIf you save and check your page, you should now be able to click on the button and see the jokes section disappear and reappear. \n\nVery well done! You're already a successful web developer.\n\n## Additional jQuery Methods\n\nThere are many, many more jQuery methods available (way too many to cover). You can find a full list of them [here](http://api.jquery.com/).\n\nAs their slogan has it, with jQuery the intent is to \"write less, do more\". It allows you to very easily perform tasks and manage behaviors on your page without having to write lengthy, complicated code for common situations. As your web project grows more interactive, the potential for using more jQuery grows along with it.\n\n## Review Questions\n\n1.

In this lesson, we'll build a digital version of a famous poem that will allow users to click on aspects of the poem to see more information about the literary devices being used. It is meant to be an educational tool for anyone who is interested in the techniques utilized in the poem.\n\nAs a preliminary note, this lesson might take you a bit longer to get through. We will be learning about a variety of important new concepts, so take your time and try to understand each step before moving on. \n\nAre you ready? \n\nLet's get into it!\n\n## The Poem\n\nBecause we are all in NYC and have likely experienced the throbbing, perpetual daylight of Times Square, as a dataset let's work with Walt Whitman's famous poem _Broadway_, published in 1888. Here is the poem in its entirety:\n\n    Broadway\n    Walt Whitman\n\n    What hurrying human tides, or day or night!\n    What passions, winnings, losses, ardors, swim thy waters!\n    What whirls of evil, bliss and sorrow, stem thee!\n    What curious questioning glances- glints of love!\n    Leer, envy, scorn, contempt, hope, aspiration!\n    Thou portal- thou arena- thou of the myriad long-drawn lines and groups!\n    (Could but thy flagstones, curbs, facades, tell their inimitable tales;\n    Thy windows rich, and huge hotels- thy side-walks wide;)\n    Thou of the endless sliding, mincing, shuffling feet!\n    Thou, like the parti-colored world itself- like infinite, teeming,\n    mocking life!\n    Thou visor'd, vast, unspeakable show and lesson!\n\nOur goal will be to create a page that prints these lines and turns certain parts into clickable elements. When the user does click, the page will display a message below the text that contains information about that element.\n\n## Setting Up the Page\n\nLet's create a new page specifically for our poem. Perhaps the simplest way for now will be to just create a link to our page in the `index.html` file. So, within the `\u003cdiv\u003e` container on your page, add the following code for a link:\n\n```HTML\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003ca href=\"poem.html\"\u003eWalt Whitman's \u003cem\u003eBroadway\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n```\n\nThe `\u003cem\u003e\u003c/em\u003e` tags stand for emphasis, which allows us to italicize words.\n\nNext, create a new file (by clicking the New File button in the VSCode Explorer Window) called `poem.html`. Paste into it this basic structure:\n\n```html\n\u003c!doctype html\u003e\n\u003chtml lang=\"en\"\u003e\n  \u003chead\u003e\n    \u003cmeta charset=\"utf-8\"\u003e\n    \u003ctitle\u003eWalt Whitman's Broadway\u003c/title\u003e\n    \u003clink rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"poem.css\"\u003e\n  \u003c/head\u003e\n  \u003cbody\u003e\n    \u003cdiv class=\"container\"\u003e\n      \u003ch1\u003e\u003cem\u003eBroadway\u003c/em\u003e by Walt Whitman\u003c/h1\u003e\n      \u003cdiv id=\"intro\"\u003e\n        \u003cp\u003eWelcome to the page for Walt Whitman's poem \u003cem\u003eBroadway\u003c/em\u003e. Hover over elements to see more information about them.\u003c/p\u003e\n      \u003c/div\u003e\n      \u003cdiv id=\"poem\"\u003e\n      \u003c/div\u003e\n      \u003cdiv id=\"info\"\u003e\n      \u003c/div\u003e\n    \u003cscript src=\"https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.6.0.min.js\"\u003e\u003c/script\u003e\n    \u003cscript src=\"poem.js\"\u003e\u003c/script\u003e\n  \u003c/body\u003e\n\u003c/html\u003e\n```\n\nYou'll see that we are adding a new dedicated stylesheet to work with `poem.css`, as well as a new script file to work with `poem.js`. Let's go ahead and create those now (again click New File \u003e `poem.css` and `poem.js`).\n\nUse the \"Go Live\" button to see your new page and make sure you are seeing the intro text display. \n\nNow that we have a page, let's convert our poem into usable JavaScript data.\n\n## Converting the Poem into Data\n\nWe have seen how both `arrays` and `objects` allow us to store large quantities of data. Here we have 11 lines of a poem, with a variable amount of words per line. We want to be able to manipulate each word as well as each line, if needed.\n\nWe could envision an array of `lines`, that stores another array of `words`. But, just like we did with our Student Grades program in a previous lesson, it would probably be best to create an `array` containing a series of `objects`. \n\nLet's take a look at what this might mean for the first line of the poem. \n\n```JavaScript\nlet line1 = [{text:  \"What\"}, {text: \"hurrying\"}, {text: \"human\"}, {text: \"tides\"}, {text: \"or\"}, {text: \"day\"}, {text: \"or\"}, {text: \"night!\"}];\n```\n\nHere we have the first line of the poem, broken up into words. Each word is an `object` with a `text` property that designates each word of the poem.\n\n### The `map()` Method\n\nTo perform an operation on each of these elements, we can use a new JavaScript method called `map()`. This method allows us to iterate over each element of an array and perform an operation (specifically, a function) on each element.\n\nThis method takes the function as an argument and runs that function's operations as it iterates. In doing so, it will create a new array that you can use to store the results of the function without altering the original array.  In short, you use `.map()` whenever you want to build an array out of another array. In this case, we want to create a new array that contains the text of each word in the poem.\n\n```JavaScript\nlet line1TextArray = []\nline1TextArray = line1.map(function(word) {\n  return word.text;\n}); \n```\n\n`.map()` here creates a new array out of the array of word objects, and this new array contains just the `.text` property (the words) of each object. \n\nNow, we can put the phrase back together using another new method.\n\n### The `join()` Method\n\nThe `join()` method returns an array as a string. In other words, when applied to our array of words, it will return them together as a string, with spaces in between each word.\n\n```JavaScript\nlet line1Text = line1TextArray.join(\" \");\n```\n\nLet's put it all together in our `poem.js` file to see what it looks like.\n\n```JavaScript\n$(\"#info\").html(\"\u003cp\u003eThe info will go here.\u003c/p\u003e\");\nlet line1, line1Text; // don’t need the intermediate step of line1TextArray\nline1 = [{text:  \"What\"}, {text: \"hurrying\"}, {text: \"human\"}, {text: \"tides\"}, \n    {text: \"or\"}, {text: \"day\"}, {text: \"or\"}, {text: \"night!\"}];\nline1Text = line1.map(function(word){\n    return word.text;\n    }).join(\" \");\n$(\"#poem\").html(\"\u003cp\u003e\" + line1Text + \"\u003cbr /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\");\n```\n\nIf you save and check your page in the browser, you should see that we have successfully displayed the first line of the poem.\n\n![Poem first line](/images/poem_first_line.png)\n\n## Adding Information to the Poem\n\nNext, we'll want a way to display information about certain elements of the poem. To indicate which ones, we can add another property to specific word objects. Let's add a new property `info` that will provide information about the literary device being used.\n\n```JavaScript\n    line1 = [{text:  \"What\", info: \"Anaphora: The repetition of a word or phrase at the beginning of (usually successive) lines. For example, the use of What in the first four lines.\"}, \n        {text: \"hurrying\"}, {text: \"human\"}, {text: \"tides\"}, \n        {text: \"or\"}, {text: \"day\"}, {text: \"or\"}, {text: \"night!\"}];\n```\n\nHere you can see that we have added a new `info` property to the first word of the poem to describe the technique of [anaphora](https://literarydevices.net/anaphora/). \n\nThis way, we can send this info down to the `#info` div on the page when the user clicks the word. \n\n## Making Elements Clickable\n\nYou might recall our brief discussion of _events_ in the previous lesson. Events are the actions that occur when a user interacts with a certain element. For instance, when a user clicks on a button, a certain event occurs. \n\nWe want the user to be able to click on a word to find the appropriate information about it. Do you recall how we might accomplish this?\n\nWe can use the `click` event, of course! It will allow us to listen for a user's click on a certain element. To do this, however, we'll need to revamp our code a bit. We want to use word-size chunks of data here, so we'll need to get rid of our `.join()` method from before and instead iterate through the array word by word.\n\nFor now, just paste the following to overwrite all your current code:\n\n```JavaScript\n$(\"#info\").html(\"\u003cp\u003eThe info will go here.\u003c/p\u003e\");\nlet line1, line1Text; // don’t need the intermediate step of line1TextArray\nline1 = [{text:  \"What\", info: \"Anaphora: The repetition of a word or phrase at the beginning of (usually successive) lines. For example, the use of What in the first four lines.\"}, \n    {text: \"hurrying\"}, {text: \"human\"}, {text: \"tides\"}, \n    {text: \"or\"}, {text: \"day\"}, {text: \"or\"}, {text: \"night!\"}];\n// Create a blank string that opens two tags.\nline1Text = \"\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003e\"; // opening tags for blockquote and p, we close them in the loop below\nline1.map(function(word){\n  // Add in the word object’s .text property plus a space.\n  line1Text = line1Text + word.text + \" \";\n});\n// Break the line and close the two tags.\nline1Text = line1Text + \"\u003cbr /\u003e(line 2 would go here)\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\";\n$(\"#poem\").html(line1Text);\n```\n\nIf you save and check your page, you'll see functionally the same result as before. We use the `map()` method to iterate through the array of word objects, setting `line1Text` to the `.text` property of each word object and add spacing. We then use the `.html()` method to set the `#poem` `\u003cdiv\u003e` to the string we created. \n\nNext we'll want to check if a specific word has an `info` property. We can accomplish this by using an `if` statement within our `map()` method, like so:\n\n```JavaScript\nline1.map(function(word){\n  // Define a variable that will be the entirety of a single\n  // word-sized chunk of information.\n  let wordString;\n  wordString = word.text;\n  // Test to see if the .info property exists.\n  if (word.info){\n    // If it does, surround wordString in an \u003ca\u003e tag.\n    wordString = \"\u003ca href='#'\u003e\" + wordString + \"\u003c/a\u003e\";\n  }\n  // Add wordString plus a space to the line1Text.\n  line1Text = line1Text + wordString + \" \";\n});\n$(\"#poem\").html(line1Text);\n```\n\nFor each word in the array, we check to see if it has an `info` property using an `if` statement (if word.info == True). If it does, we add an `\u003ca\u003e` tag to the word, which will turn the word element into a clickable link. By capturing this in `wordString`, we can add it to the overall `line1Text` string phrase as usual. Otherwise, `wordString` will just be the word itself and get added as well.\n\nIf you save, you should be able to see the poem with \"What\" now clickable. If it you do click it, however, nothing will happen yet. Let's add in our `click` event listener:\n\n```JavaScript\n$(\"#poem a\").click(function(){\n    $(\"#info\").html(\"\u003ch2\u003eYou clicked on a word!\u003c/h2\u003e\");\n  });\n```\n\nIf you save and click on the word now, you should see \"This is where the info will go\" replaced by \"You clicked on a word!\". What's happening here is that we're listening for a click on every element in the page marked with an `\u003ca\u003e` tag (by using `#poem a`). Because we marked \"What\" with an `\u003ca\u003e`, the `.click` event knows to trigger. When that happens, we're setting the `#info` `\u003cdiv\u003e` to the text \"You clicked on a word!\".\n\nAll together, the code looks like this: \n\n```JavaScript\n$(\"#info\").html(\"\u003cp\u003eThe info will go here.\u003c/p\u003e\");\nlet line1, line1Text; // don’t need the intermediate step of line1TextArray\nline1 = [{text:  \"What\", info: \"Anaphora: The repetition of a word or phrase at the beginning of (usually successive) lines. For example, the use of What in the first four lines.\"}, \n    {text: \"hurrying\"}, {text: \"human\"}, {text: \"tides\"}, \n    {text: \"or\"}, {text: \"day\"}, {text: \"or\"}, {text: \"night!\"}];\n// Create a blank string that opens two tags.\nline1Text = \"\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003e\"; // opening tags for blockquote and p, we close them in the loop below\nline1.map(function(word){\n  // Define a variable that will be the entirety of a single\n  // word-sized chunk of information.\n  let wordString;\n  wordString = word.text;\n  // Test to see if the .info property exists.\n  if (word.info){\n    // If it does, surround wordString in an \u003ca\u003e tag.\n    wordString = \"\u003ca href='#'\u003e\" + wordString + \"\u003c/a\u003e\";\n  }\n  // Add wordString plus a space to the line1Text.\n  line1Text = line1Text + wordString + \" \";\n});\n$(\"#poem\").html(line1Text);\n$(\"#poem a\").click(function(){\n    // Define the text and the word that was clicked.\n    let infoText, clickedWord;\n    clickedWord = $( this ).text();\n    infoText = \"\u003ch2\u003eYou clicked on the word: \" + clickedWord + \"\u003c/h2\u003e\";\n    $(\"#info\").html(infoText);\n  });\n```\n\nOkay, we now have clickable elements that allow us to display info about words. However, we want to actually display the info in the `info` property we wrote out.\n\nThere are a few step we'll need to take to carry this out.\n\n## Accessing the Info Property\n\nWe have two things to accomplish here. First, we want to send specific information to the `#info` div. Second, we want that data to be the `info` property of the word that was clicked.\n\nLet's tackle the first part. We'll need to modify our `click` event listener:\n\n```JavaScript\n$(\"#poem a\").click(function(){\n    // Define the text and the word that was clicked.\n    let infoText, clickedWord;\n    clickedWord = $( this ).text();\n    infoText = \"\u003ch2\u003eYou clicked on the word: \" + clickedWord + \"\u003c/h2\u003e\";\n    $(\"#info\").html(infoText);\n  });\n```\n\nWe have a new element introduced here: the keyword `this`. In this context, `this` indicates a reference to the object that is currently being acted upon (e.g., whatever word that was just clicked). In short, we can use `this` to access the `.text` property of the word that was just clicked, whichever word that may be.\n\nWe haven't quite accomplished what we want here, but we're getting there. We can now access at least the `.text` property of the word that was clicked, but we still need to get at the `.info` property.\n\nTo do this, we'll need to use __data attributes__. Data attributes allow us to store data on an element and access it. They are custom-made attributes that we can apply on HTML elements.\n\nLet's make one, called `data-info`, and use it to modify the string of text we create in our `.map()` method:\n\n```JavaScript\nline1.map(function(word){\n  // Define a variable that will be the entirety of a single\n  // word-sized chunk of information.\n  let wordString;\n  wordString = word.text;\n  // Test to see if the .info property exists.\n  if (word.info){\n    // Add the data-info attribute to the word.\n    wordString = \"\u003ca href='#' data-info='\" + word.info + \"'\u003e\" + wordString + \"\u003c/a\u003e\";\n  }\n  // Add wordString plus a space to the line1Text.\n  line1Text = line1Text + wordString + \" \";\n});\n```\n\nHere we have added a new data attribute and utilized it to store the `.info` property of the word that was clicked. Be careful about copying this correctly: you'll notice that we need to close the opening `\u003ca` and `data-info` attribute with a `\u003e` closing tag, as well as correct opening and closing quotes to indicate the info is a string.\n\nIf you check the HTML element inspector in your browser, you should see that the info text is now stored in the `data-info` attribute.\n\nWe can now access this data attribute in our `click` event listener, using the `.data` method:\n\n```JavaScript\n$(\"#poem a\").click(function(){\n    let infoText, clickedWord, clickedInfo; //variables to capture the info text and the clicked text/info\n    clickedWord = $( this ).text(); // get the clicked word\n    // .data(\"info\") looks for the data-info HTML attribute.\n    clickedInfo = $( this ).data(\"info\"); // get the info from the clicked word using .data\n    infoText = clickedInfo; // set the info text var to the clicked info\n    $(\"#info\").html(infoText); // change the info div to the info text\n  });\n```\n\nIf you save and try to click on the word now, you should be rewarded with the info that was stored in the `.info` property about anaphora.\n\nOkay! So far so good. We've added in the ability to display info about words. However, all we currently have is one line of text. Surely we'd like to add _all_ the lines of the poem, right? Let's go about doing that now.\n\n## JSON\n\nTo use our dataset (our poem) more efficiently, we'll use JSON. JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation. We can use a JSON object (as a separate file) to store our poem data, and then use that data to populate our poem. \n\nJSON, as a data format, allows us to store data in a structured way and utilize it in a variety of ways in JavaScript. Like object syntax you have seen so far, JSON object data is written in key/value pairs. For instance, here's a object containing details about an example person named Charity Case in JSON:\n\n```JSON\n{\n   \"firstName\": \"Charity\",\n   \"lastName\": \"Case\",\n   \"age\": 30,\n   \"streetAddress\": \"404 Internet Dr\",\n   \"city\": \"JavaTown\",\n   \"state\": \"JA\",\n   \"postalCode\": \"12345\",\n   \"phoneNumbers\": [\n      { \"Mobile\": \"111-111-1111\" },\n      { \"Home\": \"222-222-2222\" }\n   ]\n}\n```\n\nAs you can see, we store data in key/value pairs as usual, and we can use both object and array syntax.\n\nUsing JSON, we can store our poem in a file called `poem.json`. As you might imagine, writing it all out is a bit of a pain, so luckily for you I've already done it. Download the `poem.json` file from the button below and save it to your working folder.\n\n\u003cDownload files='poem.json'\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\n\nIf you open the file in VSCode, you can see that we have stored the lines of the text in a similar fashion as we did before, with a `text` property for each word of the poem. I also went ahead and added a few extra literary devices for the first half of the poem and listed them as `info`. \n\nIn general, just keep in mind that:\n1. JSON objects are very much like JavaScript objects.\n2. JSON objects are written in key/value pairs.\n3. JSON objects are surrounded by curly braces `{ }`.\n4. Keys must be strings, and values must be a valid JSON data type (string, number, object, array, boolean or null).\n5. Keys and values are separated by a colon.\n6. Each key/value pair is separated by a comma.\n7. Arrays are enclosed in square brackets `[ ]` and each element is separated by a comma.\n\nNow that we have a full JSON file with our poem, let's use it to populate our page with the text. We'll need to revamp our code one more time to accomplish this. \n\nTo clearly observe the logic of what we have so far, let's take a look at the 3 different parts to our program:\n\n```JavaScript\n//Part 1 - Define the extra information section for the poem\n$(\"#info\").html(\"\u003cp\u003eExtra info will go here.\u003c/p\u003e\");\n\n// Part 2 - Display the first line of the poem and access info from the poem object if it exists\nlet line1, line1Text;\nline1 = [{text:  \"What\", info: \"Anaphora: The repetition of a word or phrase at the beginning of (usually successive) lines. For example, the use of What in the first four lines.\"}, \n    {text: \"hurrying\"}, {text: \"human\"}, {text: \"tides,\"}, \n    {text: \"or\"}, {text: \"day\"}, {text: \"or\"}, {text: \"night!\"}];\nline1Text = \"\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003e\"; \nline1.map(function(word){\n  let wordString;\n  wordString = word.text;\n  if (word.info){\n    wordString = \"\u003ca href='#' data-info='\"+ word.info + \"'\u003e\" + wordString + \"\u003c/a\u003e\";\n  }\n  line1Text = line1Text + wordString + \" \";\n});\n$(\"#poem\").html(line1Text);\n\n// Part 3 - Add the click event listener to the poem\n$(\"#poem a\").click(function(){\n    let infoText, clickedWord, clickedInfo;\n    clickedWord = $( this ).text();\n    clickedInfo = $( this ).data(\"info\");\n    infoText = clickedInfo;\n    $(\"#info\").html(infoText);\n  });\n```\n\nI have deleted all the earlier comments, so just look at the three new ones I've added here. We can see that we have 3 parts to our program:\n- Part 1 - Define the extra information section for the poem\n- Part 2 - Display the first line of the poem and access `info` from the poem object if it exists\n- Part 3 - Add the click event listener to the poem\n\nIt is clear that we'll need to revamp part 2 to display the full data from the JSON file instead of just the first line we manually inputted. Let's do just that. We'll use the `getJSON` method to retrieve the data from the JSON file. We'll also create a new variable that will store all the text of the poem garnered from the JSON file.\n\n```JavaScript\n//Part 1 - Define the extra information section for the poem\n$(\"#info\").html(\"\u003cp\u003eExtra info will go here.\u003c/p\u003e\");\n\n// Part 2 - Display the first line of the poem and access info from the poem object if it exists\n$.getJSON(\"poem.json\", function(data){ // data variable is the JSON object\n  let poemText; // Define a new variable to hold all text\n  poemText = \"\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003e\"; // Open the starting tags\n  // Now you can iterate (map) over the data variable’s .lines property:\n  data.lines.map(function(line){ // We get a variable, line\n    // Define a blank lineText.\n    let lineText = \"\";\n    // Now iterate over each word. This part should be familiar to you from before\n    line.map(function(word){\n      let wordString;\n      wordString = word.text;\n      if (word.info){\n        wordString = \"\u003ca href='#' data-info='\" + word.info + \"'\u003e\" + wordString + \"\u003c/a\u003e\";\n      }\n      lineText = lineText + wordString + \" \"; // Add the word to the lineText variable with spacing\n    });\n    // Add lineText with a line break to the poemText\n    poemText = poemText + lineText + \"\u003cbr/\u003e\";\n  });\n  // Close the poemText tags\n  poemText = poemText + \"\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\";\n  // Replace the content of #poem\n  $(\"#poem\").html(poemText);\n  // Now that we have the data, we can add the click event listener to the poem\n  $(\"#poem a\").click(function(){\n    let infoText, clickedWord, clickedInfo;\n    clickedWord = $( this ).text();\n    // .data(\"info\") looks for the data-info HTML attribute\n    clickedInfo = $( this ).data(\"info\");\n    infoText = clickedInfo;\n    $(\"#info\").html(infoText);\n  });\n}); // Close the getJSON method and callback function\n```\n\nThere is some new syntax and logic here, so try to follow along with the comments. We're first using a selector and the `getJSON()` method to retrieve the data from the JSON file. `getJSON()` takes two arguments: the source of the JSON file, and what's called a __callback function__. Callback functions are functions that are passed in as arguments to other functions. In this case, we're passing in a function that takes one argument, which is the `data` from the JSON file.\n\nIn other words, the essential moves of the code are as follows:\n- Run the `getJSON()` method, passing in the `poem.json` file as the source.\n- Call the callback function, passing in the `data` variable (the JSON object).\n- Create a new variable to hold all the text of the poem.\n- `map()` over the data variable's `lines` property.\n- `map()` over each word in each line.\n- Make elements clickable if they have `info` data.\n- Add each line to the `poemText` variable with a line break, and add the text to the `#poem` element.\n- Run the `click()` method on the `#poem` element, to see if the user clicks on a word.\n\nAll together, your program should now look something like this:\n\n```JavaScript\n//Part 1 - Define the extra information section for the poem\n$(\"#info\").html(\"\u003cp\u003eExtra info will go here.\u003c/p\u003e\");\n\n// Part 2 - Display the poem and allow for clicking on words\n$.getJSON(\"poem.json\", function(data){ // data variable is the JSON object\n  let poemText; // Define a new variable to hold all text\n  poemText = \"\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003e\"; // Open the starting tags\n  // Now you can iterate (map) over the data variable’s .lines property:\n  data.lines.map(function(line){ // We get a variable, line\n    // Define a blank lineText.\n    let lineText = \"\";\n    // Now iterate over each line. This part should be familiar to you from before\n    line.map(function(word){\n      let wordString;\n      wordString = word.text;\n      if (word.info){\n        wordString = \"\u003ca href='#' data-info='\" + word.info + \"'\u003e\" + wordString + \"\u003c/a\u003e\";\n      }\n      lineText = lineText + wordString + \" \"; // Add the word to the lineText variable with spacing\n    });\n    // Add lineText with a line break to the poemText\n    poemText = poemText + lineText + \"\u003cbr/\u003e\";\n  });\n  // Close the poemText tags\n  poemText = poemText + \"\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\";\n  // Replace the content of #poem\n  $(\"#poem\").html(poemText);\n  // Now that we have the data, we can add the click event listener to the poem\n  $(\"#poem a\").click(function(){\n    let infoText, clickedWord, clickedInfo;\n    clickedWord = $( this ).text();\n    // .data(\"info\") looks for the data-info HTML attribute\n    clickedInfo = $( this ).data(\"info\");\n    infoText = clickedInfo;\n    $(\"#info\").html(infoText);\n  });\n}); // Close the getJSON method and callback function\n```\n\nSave and check the page. You should now see the full poem and have a few clickable elements to explore.\n\nCongrats! You now have a workable dataset and some interesting ways to display and interact with it. We've covered quite a lot of new terrain in this lesson, but for the most part, we are still just utilizing the foundational skills and tools you've encountered so far. \n\nIn the next lesson, we'll introduce a brand new tool called Leaflet. We'll learn how to use Leaflet to add interactive maps to our web pages.\n\nBut, as major takeaways from this lesson, just keep in mind that:\n- We usually want to break down data into smaller, discrete pieces we can manipulate\n- JSON allows you to store data in a structured way and work with it\n- Data attributes are used to store extra information that you may want to access or display\n- Events are used to trigger actions when something happens\n\n## Asynchronous vs Synchronous?\n\n## Review Questions\n\n1. True or False - `map()` allows you to iterate over an array, but it doesn't return anything.\n\n\u003cQuiz\u003e\n- True\n- False*\n\u003c/Quiz\u003e\n\n2. True or False - We can import a JSON dataset as an `object` in JavaScript.\n\n\u003cQuiz\u003e\n- True*\n- False\n\u003c/Quiz\u003e\n\n3. The following code would affect which element?\n\n\n```JavaScript\n$(\"#poem h3\").click(function(){\n    // some action\n});\n```\n\n\u003cQuiz\u003e\n- The paragraph element\n- The header element*\n- The info element\n- The body element\n\u003c/Quiz\u003e\n\n## Challenges\n\n1. Our poem page is quite bland. Spruce it up however you'd like by marshalling your CSS skills.\n\n2. `.map()` is an important method. Get a little practice in by writing a new function that takes an array of integers and, using `.map()`, returns an array of those integers, doubled. So if we give it [1, 2, 3], we receive, in turn, [2, 4, 6]. Display this info in the console.\n\n3. `.map()` is similar to another method, `.forEach()`. We haven't covered the latter, but you may encounter it in the wild. Read through [this article](https://codeburst.io/javascript-map-vs-foreach-f38111822c0f) to understand the differences between the two, and to learn a little more about `.map()` specifically.\n\n4. Add a new property to the JSON file that stores a wiki link for a particular literary device (e.g., [here for anaphora](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaphora_(rhetoric)). Create a new data attribute to access this property and add it to the info message that is displayed when clicked. \n\n## Key Terms\n\nDo you recall the meaning of the following terms?\n\n- `.map()`\n- `.join()`\n- `.getJSON()`\n- data attributes\n- events\n- callbacks\n\n# Leaflet\n\nThe last lesson exposed us to a variety of good programming practices. For instance, we separated out our data into a JSON file instead of simply creating a `line1`, `line2`, `line3`, ... `line11` set of arrays to populate our poem. While that also would have worked, it is repetitive and inefficient. Instead, we made some basic assumptions about our data (that a `.lines` property could exist as an array of word objects that we could `.map()` over) and followed that approach, creating a new JSON file object. Separating out our logic for the program and the data we were working with is a good example of __modular__ programming:  of separating out our code into smaller building blocks that ultimately work together to create a whole project.\n\nIn this lesson, we'll work with a new tool called __Leaflet__. Leaflet is an open-source JavaScript library (like jQuery) that will help us add interactive maps to our web pages. Interactive maps have become one of the most popular ways to visualize and explore spatial data. This will ultimately require us to decide how to aggregate, categorize, combine, and visualize our data. All of these decisions, plus the context of the map on your page, will influence the story that the map tells. Thinking about your data as a story (no matter what the data is), is a good way to reckon with the ethical dimensions of web development.\n\nOn that note, and given current events, it is probably worth mentioning that Leaflet was created by a Ukrainian programmer in Kyiv. On [their main page](https://leafletjs.com/), you can read about the maintainers' sentiments on the war. This is a good time to reflect on how even well-established programming libraries can be affected by social and political forces, and also how they can be utilized in ways that were once unimaginable.\n\nKeeping these ideas in mind, let's get started working with Leaflet.\n\n## Web Maps\n\nYou are likely very familiar with web maps. I personally have found myself quite lost in NYC before. While \"being lost\" is not necessarily a bad way of being, if you have a specific destination (not to mention a certain time) in mind, having a map is quite helpful. You know what I mean-- Google or Apple provide us with interactive geo-location almost every second of our lives.\n\nBefore we begin integrating web maps into our project, it might be helpful to consider the basic \"layering\" of a web map.\n\nWeb maps can be layered in many ways, but the most basic can resolve into 2 layers:\n\n1. The background layer (the map itself, with all its internal data about streets, boroughs, cities).\n2. The foreground layer (the interactive parts: the markers, lines, and other elements of the map you can manipulate, such as the marker indicating my lost self wandering around).\n\n## \n\n# Reading Documentation\n\n# Starting Your Project\n\n# Create the Page\n\n# Building Interactivity / Integrating JS\n\n# Going Live\n\n\n\nUp to this point our work has faded into the past at every screen refresh. Ephemerality is not a feature much appreciated in programming. To get started on something more permanent, let's set up a practice folder to hold our code. Call it `javascript`, or whatever you want, as long as you promise to remember it. Throughout this class, we will be working in this folder.\nClick this button to download a couple of files we'll be needing. Add them to your working folder.\n\u003cDownload files='index.html, script.js'\u003e\n\n## The HTML\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst we need to understand the HTML. HTML is the markup language that is used to create web pages. It is a simple language that is used to describe the structure of a web page. \n    \n```html\n\u003c!doctype HTML\u003e\n\u003chtml lang=\"en\"\u003e\n  \u003chead\u003e\n    \u003cmeta charset=\"utf-8\"\u003e\n    \u003ctitle\u003eMy JavaScripting Master's Student Project\u003c/title\u003e\n  \u003c/head\u003e\n  \u003cbody\u003e\n    \u003ch1\u003eThis is my project!\u003c/h1\u003e\n    \u003cdiv id=\"response\"\u003eThis is the #response div.\u003c/div\u003e\n    \u003cscript src=\"https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.2.1.min.js\"\u003e\u003c/script\u003e\n    \u003cscript src=\"scripts.js\"\u003e\u003c/script\u003e\n  \u003c/body\u003e\n\u003c/html\u003e\n```\n\n## The JavaScript\n\n```javascript\nalert('Hey, it worked!');\n```\n\n\u003cJSConsole /\u003e\n\n\n\nLoops are a way to repeat a block of code a certain number of times. Deciding when and how often to repeat a block of code is a huge part of what makes programming useful. One key concept of looping is 'iteration'. Iteration is moving through a series of items, one at a time. Here is an example of a loop iterating through a list of numbers:\n\n```javascript\nvar numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\nfor (var i = 0; i \u003c numbers.length; i++) {\n    console.log(numbers[i]);\n}\n```\n\nNotice that we set a variable called `i` to 0. This is called the 'initialization' of the loop. We then set the condition that the loop will run as long as `i` is less than the length of the array. This is called the 'test'. We then increment `i` by 1. This is called the 'update'. We use that index to get the value at that index in the array. So, in order, we initialize, test, and update.\n\nLet's talk through the loop we made. First, we initialize the loop. We set `i` to 0. Then, we test the condition. We check to see if `i` is less than the length of the array. If it is, we move on to the next step. If it isn't, we exit the loop. Then, we update the loop. We increment `i` by 1. We repeat the loop until `i` is greater than or equal to the length of the array. Inside the loop, we use the index `i` to get the value at that index in the array. So, we get the value at index 0, then the value at index 1, then the value at index 2, etc.\n\nLet's add a loop to our index.html file. We'll use the same code as before, but this time we'll add a button to the page that will run the loop.\n\n## The HTML\n\n```html\n\u003c!doctype HTML\u003e\n\u003chtml lang=\"en\"\u003e\n    \u003chead\u003e\n        \u003cmeta charset=\"utf-8\"\u003e\n        \u003ctitle\u003eMy JavaScripting Master's Student Project\u003c/title\u003e\n        \u003cscript src=\"https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.2.1.min.js\"\u003e\u003c/script\u003e\n        \u003cscript src=\"scripts.js\"\u003e\u003c/script\u003e\n    \u003c/head\u003e\n    \u003cbody\u003e\n        \u003ch1\u003eThis is my project!\u003c/h1\u003e\n        \u003cdiv id=\"response\"\u003eThis is the #response div.\u003c/div\u003e\n        \u003cbutton id=\"button\"\u003eClick me!\u003c/button\u003e\n    \u003c/body\u003e\n\u003c/html\u003e\n```\n\n## The JavaScript\n\n```javascript\nvar numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\n$('#button').click(function() {\n    for (var i = 0; i \u003c numbers.length; i++) {\n        console.log(numbers[i]);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nSee how we're connecting the button to the loop? We're using the `$` function to select the element with the id `button`. We're also using the `click` function to run the loop when the button is clicked.\n\n\n\nFunctions are a way to group code together. They are useful for keeping your code organized. They are also a great way to reuse code. Here's an example:\n\n```javascript\nfunction add(a, b) {\n    return a + b;\n}\n```\n\nThis function is called `add`. It takes two parameters, `a` and `b`. It then returns the sum of `a` and `b`. What does it mean to `return` something? Let's take a look:\n\n```javascript\nvar newValue = add(1, 2);\nconsole.log(newValue);\n```\n\nWhat does `newValue` equal? It equals 3. This is because we called the function `add` with the parameters 1 and 2, which returned 3. So, returning something is a way to get the value of something, just like getting the end result of a calculation.\n\nSo, you could call this function a machine that adds two numbers. Let's talk about the syntax:\n\n```javascript\n    `function name(parameter1, parameter2) {`\n    `    code to run`\n    `}`\n``` \n\nInside the parentheses, we're defining the parameters. This is just like defining variables, but they're used to pass values into the function. Let's try it out.\n\n```javascript\nvar firstNumber = 1;\nvar secondNumber = 2;\nvar c = add(firstNumber, secondNumber);\nconsole.log(c);\n```\n\nThis is something that all learning programmers have to wrap their head around. INSIDE the function, `firstNumber` and `secondNumber` are known as `a` and `b`. We're calling the function `add` and passing `a` and `b` into it. The function then returns the sum of `a` and `b`. This move is confusing at first, but is key to understanding how functions work. Let's try another one.\n\n```javascript\nfunction howFeel(mood) {\n    if (mood === 'happy') {\n        return 'I feel happy!';\n    } else if (mood === 'sad') {\n        return 'I feel sad!';\n    } else {\n        return 'I feel neutral!';\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNotice that we've included an if/else statement. Everything we've learned up to this point can be used in a function. Here's another one, this time looping through a list:\n\n```javascript\nvar NYBoroughs = ['Manhattan', 'Bronx', 'Brooklyn', 'Queens', 'Staten Island'];\nfor (var i = 0; i \u003c NYBoroughs.length; i++) {\n    if (NYBoroughs[i] === 'Queens') {\n        console.log('Queens has the best food!');\n    } else {\n        console.log(NYBoroughs[i]);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n\u003cJSTerminal /\u003e\n\n\u003cCodeEditor language='javascript'\u003e\nvar t = 10;\n\u003c/CodeEditor\u003e\n\n\n\nWhen encountering an error, the browser will stop running the code. It will show an error message. The error will show a few things:\n\n- The line of code that caused the error\n- The error message\n- The stack trace\n\nThere are a few main types of errors:\n\n- Syntax errors\n- Runtime errors\n- Logical errors\n\nSyntax errors are when the code is not written correctly. Runtime errors are when the code is written correctly, but the computer is not able to run it. Logical errors are when the code is written correctly, but the computer is not able to run it because it is not doing what it should.\n\nWhen you have a syntax error, the error report will show you the line of code that caused the error. It is not always clear where the error is. It is often the line of code that comes after the error (??). There are online resources that can help you find the error, such as [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/). Stack Overflow is a great place to find answers to your questions. The people there are not always friendly.\n\nIf you get a runtime error, the error report will show you the line of code that caused the error. It will also show you the error message. The error message is often a little more specific than the line of code. It will also show you the stack trace. The stack trace is a list of the lines of code that were run before the error. It is often helpful to look at the stack trace to see where the error is.\n\nIf you get a logical error, the error report will show you the line of code that caused the error. It will also show you the error message. The error message is often a little more specific than the line of code. It will also show you the stack trace. The stack trace is a list of the lines of code that were run before the error. It is often helpful to look at the stack trace to see where the error is.\n\n\nYou've got to have a webpage with content in it in order to use JavaScript to manipulate it! We're going to use css Grid and Flexbox to get where we're going, so nothing like Bootstrap or etc.\n\n\n\nWe're gonna add some INTERACTIVITY to our project. We're going to add a button to the page that will ask the user for their name. We're going to add a div to the page that will show the user their name. \n\n```html\n\u003c!doctype HTML\u003e\n\u003chtml lang=\"en\"\u003e\n    \u003chead\u003e\n        \u003cmeta charset=\"utf-8\"\u003e\n        \u003ctitle\u003eMy JavaScripting Master's Student Project\u003c/title\u003e\n        \u003cscript src=\"https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.2.1.min.js\"\u003e\u003c/script\u003e\n        \u003cscript src=\"scripts.js\"\u003e\u003c/script\u003e\n    \u003c/head\u003e\n    \u003cbody\u003e\n        \u003ch1\u003eThis is my project!\u003c/h1\u003e\n        \u003cdiv id=\"response\"\u003eThis is the #response div.\u003c/div\u003e\n        \u003cbutton id=\"button\"\u003eClick me!\u003c/button\u003e\n    \u003c/body\u003e\n\u003c/html\u003e\n```\n## The JavaScript\n\n```javascript\n$('#button').click(function() {\n    var name = prompt('What is your name?');\n    $('#response').text(name);\n}\n```\n\n\n\nThe absolute most important thing to learn is how to find answers to your questions. This means learning how to ask the right questions. It comes through practice. Seeing an error\n\n\n\nObjects are a way to store data in a structured way. They are useful for storing data that has a lot of different properties. Here's an example:\n\n```javascript\n    var person = {\n        name: 'Sandra',\n        age: 30,\n        favoriteFood: 'pizza'\n    };\n```\n\nWhat's nice about this is that we can access the properties of the object using dot notation. What is the difference between dot notation and bracket notation? Let's take a look:\n```javascript\n    person.name;\n    person['name'];\n```\n\n\n\nDocumentation exists to explain what a tool is and how to use it. Too often, whether because documentation is an afterthought, or because the people responsible for making it are better programmers than communicators, technical documentation fails to make itself clear. Paradoxically, it is often necessary to already be familiar with using a tool in order to interpret the instructions about how to use it.\n\n\n\nD3 is a JavaScript library that allows you to create visualizations. Other tools are higher-level libraries that have more assumptions about how to use them. D3 is less opinionated about how to use it. It is more flexible. It is more robust. It is more efficient. It is more powerful. BUT it is more complicated.
