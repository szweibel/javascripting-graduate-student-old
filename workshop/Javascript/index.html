Introduction\n\nHello! This is *The JavaScripting Masters Student*, a course designed particulary for graduate students who are not pursuing a degree in computer science. The course is designed to help you learn the fundamentals of programming and to help you get started on your own projects. The course is __not__ intended to be a comprehensive introduction to computer science concepts, but rather a step-by-step path to making something useful.\n\n## Learning Outcomes\n\nBy the end of the semester, successful students will\n\n- Gain capacity to read and write JavaScript at a beginner level.\n- Understand the core programming concepts, including variables, loops, and conditionals.\n- Distinguish among five core data types—integers, floats, strings, booleans, and arrays.\n- Engage with error output and use the internet and documentation to independently research language features.\n- Be familiar with JS libraries like Leaflet and JQuery.\n- Create a small project of their own that can live on the web!\n- Be ready for further classes that require JavaScript knowledge.\n\n\u003c!-- ## What am I doing here? Why Learn JavaScript?\n\nThere are two ways of meaning that question:\nMORE\n\n \n1. JavaScript is a good first language to learn.\n\n\"JavaScript is the language of the web\". You will have heard that, perhaps. MORE\n\n2. Learning JavaScript means learning an adaptable language that can be used to bring your work to people on the web.\nMORE --\u003e\n\n## The Process of Learning a Language\n\nThere are many ways to learn a language. In the case of human languages, the most effective is said to be full immersion. It can be very motivating to be put in a situation where learning is aligned well with a concrete goal, in this case communicating with the people around you.\n\nIn the same way, learning a programming language benefits from having a specific aim, typically a project built in that language. The problem, though, often ends up being that new learners do not know what is possible to do with a language, so it's hard to develop a clear and realistic goal. In order to help learners along their path, this course is designed as a guided process of project-oriented learning. At the end of this text, you will have finished a small project that you can put on the web, therefore getting some idea of what you can do with the language.\n\n## Cool, inspiring libraries\n\nWhat's possible with JavaScript? You can use it to create a map, a data visualization, a website, or any number of things. Below are a few examples of powerful tools that you can use to create your own projects. We will be exploring one of these, Leaflet, later in the course.\n\n- [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/)\n- [D3.js](https://d3js.org/)\n- [p5.js](https://p5js.org/)\n- [leaflet.js](https://leafletjs.com/)\n\n## JavaSCRIPT, not Java\n\nA fundamental part of learning how to program is becoming familiar with the meanings of specialist words in common use. The first thing that trips up a lot of beginners is the name of the programming language, \"JavaScript\". Often new learners will see references to \"Java\" and \"JavaScript\" and think that they are referring to the same language. They are not! But you would be forgiven for thinking so. The confusion could very nearly be called intentional! A bit of history:\n\nJava is a programming language that became popular in the 1990s. It was used primarily for desktop applications, but as the web became a bigger deal, Java was positioned as the language of choice for web development. The creator of JavaScript, Brendan Eich, wanted to hitch a ride on the success of Java and associate his new language with the more established one. Hence, \"JavaScript\". Other than the name, there is no association between the two.\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nThis material is modeled off of [The JavaScripting English Major](https://the-javascripting-english-major.org/v1/contents) by Moacir P. de Sá Pereira. Its pragmatic approach to teaching programming inspired our own, particularly in the project-oriented design of the course. Similarly [Eloquent JavaScript](https://eloquentjavascript.net/) by Marijn Haverbeke demonstrated to us a step-by-step accretive method of learning that feels fitting for an audience of non-CS majors. We were also influenced by [Learn Python the Hard Way](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/) by Zed A. Shaw, in his emphasis on engaging the reader in actual typing and not just memorizing syntax. \n\n# Getting Started with JavaScript\n\nLet's begin our journey with the JavaScript language. As is tradition, we're first going to explore some ways to print a \"Hello World!\" message as output to the screen. In doing so, you will be introduced to the basics of working with the JavaScript console. As will become clearer, you can think of the console as an interactive way to run basic JavaScript commands in your browser. \n\nTo become further acquainted with the console, we will end the lesson by exploring basic data types and variables in JavaScript, and how you can use these capabilities to calculate and display a variety of conditions.\n\n## Hello, World!\n\n### Alerts\n\nOne of the most basic ways to output a message is to use the `alert()` method. This method will display a message to the user visiting your web page, and then wait for the user to click on the \"OK\" button.\n\nTo create an alert, you can write the following line of code...\n\n```JavaScript\nalert(\"Hello, World!\");\n```\n\n...into the box below, where you can see an instance of the interactive console that we have provided for you. If you click your mouse after the `\u003e` symbol (called the _prompt_), you can begin writing your code, and then hit the \u003ckbd\u003eEnter\u003c/kbd\u003e key to run it.\n\n\u003cJSTerminal /\u003e\n\nYou should now see a pop-up box that displays your message. __Note__: If you do _not_ see a pop-up message, you may need to disable your pop-up blocker.\n\nAs you can see, the alert dialog box takes the focus and forces the user to read the specified message on the current webpage. This being the case, it is wise to avoid overusing this method because it stops the user from accessing other parts of the webpage until the box is closed. It is best used as a kind of warning message. For instance, you may have seen developers use it to notify the user that they are heading to a new external website after clicking a link.\n\nYou'll notice that our message is enclosed in `()` (parentheses) as well as `\"\"` double quotations marks. You'll understand why as we continue: this indicates part of the _syntax_, or the rules that define the structure of the JavaScript language.\n\nYou will also notice that there is a `;`(semicolon) after the `alert` command. Not including the semicolon won't throw an error, but it is good practice to include after each command, or statement--after each single instruction given to the console. You'll see more examples of this (and learn when _not_ to include semicolons) as we progress. For now, just make sure to __include the semicolon__ at the end of each line of code.\n\n### Using Your Browser's Console\n\nWhile we have provided a console for you embedded into this web page, you can also use the console to run commands directly from your browser's developer tools. Most modern browsers allow you access to a developer console where you can work with JavaScript and read or manipulate data on a page. \n\nTo open the developer console, you can use these methods:\n\n__Chrome:__\n- Command + Option + i (Mac)\n- Ctrl + Shift + i (Windows/Linux).\n- Open the Chrome settings menu in the top-right corner of your browser window and select `More Tools` \u003e `Developer Tools`\n\n__Firefox:__\n- Command + Option + i (Mac)\n- Ctrl + Shift + i (Windows/Linux)\n\n__Safari:__\n- Develop menu in Safari’s Advanced preferences\n- Right-click on any page element and select Inspect Element\n- Command + Option + i\n\n__Opera:__\n- Command + Option + i (Mac)\n- Ctrl + Shift + i (Windows/Linux)\n\nUsing these shortcuts should open a console window that you can use to run commands. After the `\u003e` prompt, create another new `alert` command and hit the \u003ckbd\u003eEnter\u003c/kbd\u003e key to run it. You should again see a pop-up box that displays your message.\n\nWe should note here that the alert's system dialog box is not related to the design of the webpage currently being shown in the browser. Its appearance depends solely on your current operating system and browser (rather than on the HTML code of the current page). You will learn how to manipulate a webpage's content and appearance directly with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS in later lessons.  \n\n### The console.log() Function\n\nLet's use another technique to display \"Hello, World!\" This time, we will use the `console.log()` function, which writes a message to the console. In your browser's developer console, write the following line of code:\n\n```JavaScript\nconsole.log(\"Hello, World!\");\n```\n\nYou should see the message \"Hello, World!\" now printed out for you in the console itself.\n\nThe `console.log()` function is a useful tool for testing and debugging your code. As you continue learning JavaScript and begin building your own webpages, you will find it an effective way to display and understand the results of your programs.\n\n__Note__: If you also receive a message of `undefined` in the console, don't worry! You will understand why this is happening as you continue learning more about how functions work in JavaScript.\n\nFor now, let's continue working with the JavaScript console by exploring the way the language deals with data and discrete bits of information.\n\n## Data Types\n\n__Data types__ form the atomic elements of JavaScript programs and are used to store and manipulate data. The basic data types in JavaScript are: __number__, __string__, __boolean__, __array__, and __object__. For now, let's just discuss the first three of these types and how you can use them.\n\n### Numbers\n\nValues of the `number` type are, as you might have guessed, numbers. Try typing the following numbers into the console, hitting the \u003ckbd\u003eEnter\u003c/kbd\u003e key after each one:\n\n```JavaScript\n\u003e 9;\n\u003e 3.8;\n\u003e -1.2;\n```\n\u003cJSTerminal /\u003e\n\nAs you can see, JavaScript recognizes a variety of different number categories. Unlike other programming languages you may (or may not) be familiar with, JavaScript does not define different types of numbers, like integer, double, etc. All numbers are recognized as the same type.\n\nWe can also perform various mathematical calculations on these numbers. For example, try running each of the following mathematical operations in the console:\n\n```JavaScript\n\u003e 5 + 5\n\u003e 5 - 5\n\u003e 5 / 5\n\u003e 5 * 5\n\u003e 5 % 6\n```\n\n\u003cJSTerminal /\u003e\n\nJavaScript effectively calculates the result of these operations for you. Whenever you can use a number, you can also create a mathematical expression using typical algebraic operators. The last example (in case you are unfamiliar) uses the \u003ckbd\u003e%\u003c/kbd\u003e (remainder) symbol, which evaluates the remainder of a division.  \n\nIn the table below, you can see more of the various operators available to you as a JS programmer when working with data types. Many of the most useful operators deal in terms of comparison:  seeing if one value is equal to, greater than, or lesser than another value. Each of these comparisons will evaluate to either true or false. It is important to understand how these operators work, so try inputting some of the examples you might be unclear with into the JS console to check out the results for yourself.\n\n\u003ctable\u003e\n    \u003ccaption\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eComparison Operators\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/caption\u003e\n    \u003ctr\u003e\n        \u003cth\u003eOperator\u003c/th\u003e\n        \u003cth\u003eMeaning\u003c/th\u003e\n        \u003cth\u003eExample\u003c/th\u003e\n        \u003cth\u003eEvaluation\u003c/th\u003e\n    \u003c/tr\u003e\n    \u003ctr\u003e\n        \u003cth rowspan = \"2\"\u003e \u003c \u003c/th\u003e\n        \u003ctd\u003e less than? \u003c/td\u003e\n        \u003ctd\u003e 5 \u003c 5 \u003c/td\u003e\n        \u003ctd\u003efalse\u003c/td\u003e\n    \u003c/tr\u003e\n   \u003ctr\u003e\n        \u003ctd\u003e less than? \u003c/td\u003e\n        \u003ctd\u003e 5 \u003c 6 \u003c/td\u003e\n        \u003ctd\u003etrue\u003c/td\u003e\n    \u003c/tr\u003e\n    \u003ctr\u003e\n        \u003cth rowspan = \"2\"\u003e \u003e \u003c/th\u003e\n        \u003ctd\u003e greater than? \u003c/td\u003e\n        \u003ctd\u003e 5 \u003e 5 \u003c/td\u003e\n        \u003ctd\u003efalse\u003c/td\u003e\n    \u003c/tr\u003e\n    \u003ctr\u003e\n        \u003ctd\u003e greater than? \u003c/td\u003e\n        \u003ctd\u003e 5 \u003e 4 \u003c/td\u003e\n        \u003ctd\u003etrue\u003c/td\u003e\n    \u003c/tr\u003e\n    \u003ctr\u003e\n        \u003cth rowspan = \"2\"\u003e\u003c=\u003c/th\u003e\n        \u003ctd\u003e less than or equal to? \u003c/td\u003e\n        \u003ctd\u003e 5 \u003c= 5 \u003c/td\u003e\n        \u003ctd\u003etrue\u003c/td\u003e\n    \u003c/tr\u003e\n    \u003ctr\u003e\n        \u003ctd\u003e less than or equal to? \u003c/td\u003e\n        \u003ctd\u003e 5 \u003c= 4 \u003c/td\u003e\n        \u003ctd\u003efalse\u003c/td\u003e\n    \u003c/tr\u003e\n    \u003ctr\u003e\n        \u003cth rowspan = \"2\"\u003e\u003e=\u003c/th\u003e\n        \u003ctd\u003e greater than or equal to? \u003c/td\u003e\n        \u003ctd\u003e 5 \u003e= 5 \u003c/td\u003e\n        \u003ctd\u003etrue\u003c/td\u003e\n    \u003c/tr\u003e\n    \u003ctr\u003e\n        \u003ctd\u003e greater than or equal to? \u003c/td\u003e\n        \u003ctd\u003e 5 \u003e= 6 \u003c/td\u003e\n        \u003ctd\u003efalse\u003c/td\u003e\n    \u003c/tr\u003e\n    \u003ctr\u003e\n        \u003cth rowspan = \"3\"\u003e==\u003c/th\u003e\n        \u003ctd\u003e equal to? \u003c/td\u003e\n        \u003ctd\u003e 5 == 5 \u003c/td\u003e\n        \u003ctd\u003etrue\u003c/td\u003e\n    \u003c/tr\u003e\n    \u003ctr\u003e\n        \u003ctd\u003e equal to? \u003c/td\u003e\n        \u003ctd\u003e 5 == 4 \u003c/td\u003e\n        \u003ctd\u003efalse\u003c/td\u003e\n    \u003c/tr\u003e\n    \u003ctr\u003e\n        \u003ctd\u003e equal to? \u003c/td\u003e\n        \u003ctd\u003e 5 == \"5\" \u003c/td\u003e\n        \u003ctd\u003etrue\u003c/td\u003e\n    \u003c/tr\u003e\n    \u003ctr\u003e\n        \u003cth rowspan = \"3\"\u003e!=\u003c/th\u003e\n        \u003ctd\u003e not equal to? \u003c/td\u003e\n        \u003ctd\u003e 5 != 5 \u003c/td\u003e\n        \u003ctd\u003efalse\u003c/td\u003e\n    \u003c/tr\u003e\n    \u003ctr\u003e\n        \u003ctd\u003e not equal to? \u003c/td\u003e\n        \u003ctd\u003e 5 != 4 \u003c/td\u003e\n        \u003ctd\u003etrue\u003c/td\u003e\n    \u003c/tr\u003e\n    \u003ctr\u003e\n        \u003ctd\u003e not equal to? \u003c/td\u003e\n        \u003ctd\u003e 5 != \"5\" \u003c/td\u003e\n        \u003ctd\u003efalse\u003c/td\u003e\n    \u003c/tr\u003e\n    \u003ctr\u003e\n        \u003cth rowspan = \"2\"\u003e===\u003c/th\u003e\n        \u003ctd\u003e \"strict\" equal to (includes type)? \u003c/td\u003e\n        \u003ctd\u003e 5 === \"5\" \u003c/td\u003e\n        \u003ctd\u003efalse\u003c/td\u003e\n    \u003c/tr\u003e\n    \u003ctr\u003e\n        \u003ctd\u003e \"strict equal\" to (includes type)? \u003c/td\u003e\n        \u003ctd\u003e 5 === 5 \u003c/td\u003e\n        \u003ctd\u003etrue\u003c/td\u003e\n    \u003c/tr\u003e\n    \u003ctr\u003e\n        \u003cth rowspan = \"2\"\u003e!==\u003c/th\u003e\n        \u003ctd\u003e \"strict\" not equal to (includes type)? \u003c/td\u003e\n        \u003ctd\u003e 5 !== \"5\" \u003c/td\u003e\n        \u003ctd\u003etrue\u003c/td\u003e\n    \u003c/tr\u003e\n    \u003ctr\u003e\n        \u003ctd\u003e \"strict\" not equal to (includes type)? \u003c/td\u003e\n        \u003ctd\u003e 5 !== 5 \u003c/td\u003e\n        \u003ctd\u003efalse\u003c/td\u003e\n    \u003c/tr\u003e\n\u003c/table\u003e\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n\u003cJSTerminal /\u003e\n\nWhile nearly all of these operators are shared amongst the majority of modern programming languages, the `===` (triple equals) is unique to JavaScript. The distinctions between `==` (double equals) and `===` (triple equals) are important. The double equals `==` operator is used to compare _only_ the value of two variables, while the \"strict\" triple equals `===` operator is used to compare the value _and_ type of two variables. The strict operator will only return true if the two variables are _exactly_ the same, both in value and in type (e.g., number or string). So, while both `5 === 5` and `\"5\" === \"5\"` will return true because they are the same value and type, `5 === \"5\"` will return false because the latter is testing a number against a string (discussed below). Also note the difference between the double equals `==` and triple equals `===`, which test for equality, and the `!=` and `!==` operators, which test for _inequality_.\n\nWe'll continue to work with comparison/equality operators throughout the course, so don't worry if they're still a bit unclear. Additionally, we have for now purposefully left out the `=` (single equals) operator, as it has a different function than evaluating equality. We'll cover the single equals operator later in this lesson.\n\n### Strings\n\nAs a data type, a __string__ is simply a series of alphanumeric characters, meaning it can combine both numbers and text into a phrase. Strings are mostly used for displaying or recognizing a series of text in your programs. You have actually already encountered a string--in the `console.log(\"Hello, World!\");` command you ran above, everything enclosed in the double-quotation marks (namely, `Hello, World!`) is considered a string. In the `\"5\" == \"5\"` example you just saw, each 5 is actually considered a _string_, rather than a number, because they are enclosed in quotation marks.\n\nJust like with numbers, you can simply type a string (for instance, `\"Hello, World!\"`) into the console and it will repeat your string back to you. It is important to note that were you to add a number to the string, e.g., `\"Hello, World in the Year 3030!\";`, the entire phrase would still be considered a string and _not_ a number. This is because you have enclosed it within double-quotation marks, which always indicates a `string` type.\n\nIt's worth noting that you can use both single- \u003ckbd\u003e'\u003c/kbd\u003e and double-quotation \u003ckbd\u003e\"\u003c/kbd\u003e marks to identify a string. It is important, however, to keep your use consistent. For instance, if you were to write `\"Hello, World!'`, beginning the phrase with double-quotes and ending with a single-quote, you will receive a `SyntaxError` (we'll cover how to deal with errors in a bit more detail later). It is best practice to primarily use double-quotes, as this allows you to use single-quotes _within_ a phrase without the console throwing errors. For example, `\"It is Jill's birthday.\"` is a perfectly valid expression, while `'It is Jill's birthday.'` is not.\n\n__Note__: If you need to use double-quotes inside of a string, there are two ways you can do this. You can, conversely, simply use single-quotation marks to surround a phrase, e.g., `'I wonder what \"truth\" means today?'`, or you can use a \u003ckbd\u003e\\\u003c/kbd\u003e (backslash) to precede a double-quotation mark within enclosed double-quotation marks, e.g. `\"I wonder what \\\"truth\\\" means today?\"`. \n\nStrings can also utilize the `+` operator to __concatenate__, or join, separate string phrases together. For example, `\"Hello, \" + \"World!\"` will return `\"Hello, World!\"`. Try it out in the console below.\n\n\u003cJSTerminal /\u003e\n\n### Boolean\n\nUnlike some real-world scenarios, determining what is true and false in JavaScript is refreshingly straightforward. __Booleans__ are data types that are either firmly `true` or `false`. In utilizing the comparison operators from the table earlier, you have already discovered how the console determines truth and falsity. For instance, typing `9 \u003e 5` evaluates to `true`, whereas `5 \u003e 9` evaluates to `false`. Similarly, `5 \u003e= 5` as well as `5 \u003c= 5` both resolve as `true`. If you simply type `true` or `false` into the console, the console recognizes it as a data type and will repeat it back to you.\n\nBooleans may seem simple, but very often in programming you will need a data type that can only have one of two values, akin to a \"yes\" or \"no\" or \"on\" or \"off\" determination. We will work more with booleans as we progress through the course.\n\nAs a final step for this lesson, let's make using data types a bit more interesting by introducing __variables__.\n\n## Variables\n\nNow that we have explored a number of data types and how to use them, let's explore how to create variables in JavaScript to utilize data types more effectively.\n\nYou can think of __variables__ as kinds of containers for data. They are named and can be assigned a value based on whatever data type is appropriate. To create a variable, you simply type the `var` keyword along with the name of the variable you want to create, followed by a single equal sign (`=`) and then the value of the variable. For example, `var myMessage = \"Hello, World!\";` will create a new variable called `myMessage` and assign it the value `\"Hello, World!\"`. Creating a variable is called __declaring__ or __defining__ it, and attributing a value to it is called __assigning__ it.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, this drastically sets apart the single equals `=` operator from the double equals `==` operator. The single equals operator is used to __assign__ a value to a variable, while the double equals operator (as well as the triple equals) is used to __test__ if two values or variables are equal to each other (without modifying either value).\n\nIn the example below, we have replicated our `Hello, World!` message, only this time using a variable. You can see that instead of simply logging the string `\"Hello, World!\"` to the console, we have assigned the string to a variable called `myMessage` and then logged the value of `myMessage` to the console.\n\n```JavaScript\n    var myMessage = \"Hello, World!\";\n    console.log(myMessage);\n```\n\nUnderstanding and working effectively with variables is probably the most important part of programming. They allow you to store data in memory, and then use that data to perform all kinds of operations upon it. Take a look at the example below:\n\n```JavaScript\nvar a = 1;\nvar b = 2;\nvar c = a + b;\n```\n\nYou'll notice that the variable `c` is assigned the value of `a + b`. In other words, here we are assigning the value of a variable to that of the addition of two other variables. What do you think the result would be if we were to `console.log(c);`? \n\nNow let's make something ever so slightly more interesting. Let's talk about the weather.\n\n```JavaScript\nvar weather = 'sunny';\nvar statement = 'The weather is ' + weather + ' today.';\n```\n\nEarlier, you saw how we can concatenate strings together to form a compound phrase. You can also use the `+` operator to combine strings and variables. In the above example, the variable `statement`, assigned `\"The weather is \" + weather + \" today.\"` will return the string `\"The weather is sunny today.\"`.\n\nAny of the data types you have already learned can be assigned to a variable. For example, you can assign a number to a variable, a string to a variable, a boolean to a variable, etc.\n\nAs your programs become more complex, it is generally good practice to declare all of your variables at the top of your program. This will make it easier to find and understand your code later. Take a look at the program below:\n\n```JavaScript\nvar book, author, isbn, description;\n\nbook = \"Hunger\";\nauthor = \"Knut Hamsun\";\nisbn = 0374525285;\n\ndescription = \"The book \" + book + \" by \" + author + \" is on ISBN \" + isbn;\nconsole.log(description);\n\nbook = \"The Master and Margarita\";\nauthor = \"Mikhail Bulgakov\";\nisbn = 0679760806;\n\ndescription = \"The book \" + book + \" by \" + author + \" is on ISBN \" + isbn;\nconsole.log(description);\n```\n\nAs you can see, we have declared all the variables we want to include for our categorization of the books at the top of the program.  It is important to note that these variables persist only for the duration of your particular session with the console. If you close the console, they will be deleted from memory. You will also notice, however, that the values of the variables are __mutable__, meaning that they can be changed as the program progresses. If you run this program in the console, each `console.log()` command will display a new description. __Note__: Certain variable types are immutable, meaning that they cannot be changed. We'll explore additional details about immutable variables in later lessons.\n\n### Variable Naming Conventions\n\nThere are a few rules for variable naming conventions in JavaScript. \n- Variables must begin with a letter or an underscore. You can't begin a variable name with a number (although you can use numbers after). \n- Variables must not contain spaces or special characters. For example, `myVariable` is a valid variable name, but `my variable` is not.\n- Variable names are case sensitive. That is, a variable named `My_Books` is treated as an entirely different variable than one named `my_books`.\n- You can't use one of JavaScript's reserved words as a variable name. All programming languages have a supply of words that are used internally by the language. For a complete list, see here: [Reserved Words](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_reserved.asp).\n- Do not include hyphens `-`. Hyphens can be misconstrued by JavaScript as attempts to subtract one value from another and will cause errors.\n\nIn general, try to keep your variable names as short and descriptive of their purpose as possible.\n\n## Using typeof\n\nLet's end our discussion of variables with one more nifty tool: the `typeof` operator. The `typeof` operator is used to determine the data type of a variable. For example, if you have a variable named `myVariable`, you can use the `typeof` operator to determine what kind of data it is.\n\n```JavaScript\nvar myVariable = \"Hello, World!\";\nconsole.log(typeof myVariable);\n```\n\nIf you look at your developer console, you should see a `string` correctly identified as the data type of `myVariable`. You can use this operator to determine the data type of any variable you have created. This can become very useful when you are working with data types that are not explicitly defined or when you are converting data types from one type to another (which we'll begin learning in the next lesson).\n\n## Review Questions\n\nLet's review some of the main concepts we've covered in this lesson and get some practice in.\n\n1. `console.log()` is best used for (select one):\n\n\u003cQuiz\u003e\n- testing and debugging your code*\n- changing the appearance of a webpage\n- warning the user about something\n\u003c/Quiz\u003e\n\n2. Select all of the following statements that will evaluate to `true`:\n\n\u003cQuiz\u003e\n- 5*\n- 5 = 5\n- 5 == 5*\n- 5 != 5\n- 5 === 5*\n- 5 !== \"5\"*\n\u003c/Quiz\u003e\n\n3. Which of these variable names are legal (valid) in JavaScript? (select all that apply)\n\n\u003cQuiz\u003e\n- my_books* \n- myBooks*\n- my-books\n- myBooks1*\n- 1my_books\n- myBooks\u0026I\n\u003c/Quiz\u003e\n\n## Challenges\n\n1. In JavaScript, as in typical algebra, ambiguity in a mathematical expression is resolved by [rules of precedence (PEMDAS)](https://www.purplemath.com/modules/orderops.htm). For example, the expression `5 + 5` is evaluated as `10`, while the expression `5 + 5 * 5` is evaluated as `30`. Using the rules of precedence and the console, rework the expression `5 + 5 * 10 /2` so that it resolves to `50`. Next, utilizing the variables defined below, write an expression that resolves to `true` using the double equals `==` operator.\n\n```JavaScript\nvar a = 15;\nvar b = 10;\nvar c = 30;\nvar d = 5;\n```\n\n\u003cJSTerminal /\u003e\n\n2. Using variables, write a simple program that 1) sends an `alert` to the user telling them to open the developer console in their browser and 2) logs a message to the console saying they have won a prize. __Note__: This is an imaginary practice scenario. In reality, you would want to avoid using `console.log()` to send messages to users when actually deploying your website. Any information you want the user of your webpage to see should be presented on the webpage itself.\n\n## Key Terms\n\nDo you recall the meaning of the following terms from this lesson?\n- boolean\n- string\n- variable\n- concatenation\n- declaration/assignment\n- mutability\n\n# If/Then\n\nSo far, we have been working with fairly simple programming structures. Our code thus far has been written as a single, linear, ordered list of instructions. However, there are other ways to structure your code that takes account of various conditions and reacts accordingly. \n\nWe are speaking here about __control flow__: the order in which the computer executes statements in a script.\n\nIn general, code is run in order from the first line in the file to the last line, unless the computer runs across the (extremely frequent) structures that change the control flow, such as conditionals and loops. We will explore several of these structures in this lesson and learn how to use them to create dynamic, branching programs. To put these skills to work, at the end of the lesson you will learn to build your own small text-based \"Choose Your Own Adventure\" game that allows players/readers to change the outcomes of a story based on their decisions. Let's get started! \n\n## Thinking in Code\n\nLet's talk about the process of thinking in code. What does someone think about before they write code? In your head, how might you imagine what the code in action would look like? \n\nIn general, we might present a few initial ideas about the process:\n1. The computer reads from top to bottom. It does things according to the instructions it reads, step by step. That's the sense in which we mean 'scripting'. My thought process is about the steps that are necessary to get from the beginning to a defined end. What kind of data do I have? How will it have to be transformed? What will be the result? That's the linear vision of scripting.\n2. Digging into the code is a lot more difficult and we really need to envision its structure. What might the structure of the code look like? What is the structure of the data itself? That's the hierarchical vision of scripting.\n3. A branching, rather than linear, vision of code is about the decisions that are made in the process of getting to the end. The branches in the program are equivalent to a \"decision tree.\" \n\n![Decision Tree](/images/decision-tree.drawio.png)\n\nThe decision tree is a visual representation of the process of getting to the end of a program. The diagram above shows how code will follow the different \"branches\" depending on the truth or falsity of a certain condition.\n\nTo aid us in thinking about what our program might look like, let's also consider what a typical \"Choose Your Own Adventure\" game would consist of. In simple terms, it would need:\n1. A predefined story (the story that the player is told)\n2. A set of choices that the player can make at certain points in the story \n3. An internal way to change the story based on the player's choices (code branching)\n4. A set of outcomes that the player can see based on their choices \n\nLet's keep these ideas in mind and use them as a rough roadmap for the rest of the lesson.\n\nFor now, let's not worry about the details of the story. Let's first start by exploring a simple way to allow the player to make choices and a way to store those choices.\n\n## Prompts\n\nOne of the simplest ways to gather user input is through the `prompt()` function. This function displays a message to the user and waits for them to enter a response in the response field. The `prompt()` function returns the user's response as a string. Let's take a look at it in detail.\n\n```JavaScript\n    var userName = prompt(\"What is your name?\");\n```\nHere is a simple example of the `prompt()` function in action. The user is asked to enter their name and waits for them to type it out and hit \u003ckbd\u003eEnter\u003c/kbd\u003e. Once the user completes their name, their response will be stored in the variable `userName`. In other words, the function __returns__ the value you enter and stores it in the variable. We'll learn more about returns in a later lesson. For now, try running the code in the console below, answer the prompt, and then type `userName` in the console to see that the variable is now populated with the name you have entered.\n\n\u003cJSTerminal /\u003e\n\nPretty nifty, right? `Prompt` code is like `alert` code, with a couple differences:\n1. In a prompt, you need a way to capture the user's response. So, you must begin the prompt with a variable declaration.\n2. In a prompt, you can specify a second message, which acts as a \"default\" value. If the user doesn't enter a response, the default message will be stored in the variable. For instance, we might make a prompt like: `var whatAmI = prompt(\"What am I?\", \"I am a human!\");`, in which `I am a human!` will prepopulate the response field and act as the default return value if the user doesn't enter anything themselves. \n\n### parseInt()\n\nIt's important to note that the user's response to a `prompt` is _always_ a string. If you want to store and handle the user's response as a number (so you can perform arithmetic on it), you will need to convert it to a number using the `parseInt()` function. The `parseInt()` function takes a string and returns the number it represents. For example, `parseInt(\"5\")` will return `5` (the number).\n\nLet's try this out now, this time asking the user their age:\n\n```JavaScript\n    var userAge = prompt(\"How old are you?\");\n    userAge = parseInt(userAge);\n    alert(\"You are \" + userAge + \" years old.\");\n    typeof userAge;\n```\n\n\u003cJSTerminal /\u003e\n\nFor this example we simply update `userAge` with the new conversion value. As you can see by checking with `typeof`, the user's response is now registered as a number.\n\n__Note:__ This is not a foolproof data type conversion tactic and is easily broken. For instance, if you type the response \"one\" into the prompt instead of 1, the `parseInt` function will return a `NaN` (Not a Number) value. The `NaN` value is a special value that is returned when you try to perform arithmetic on a value that is not recognized as a number. For our purposes at the moment, however, this technique will suffice.\n\n## If/Else Statements\n\nSo far so good--we now have a way to capture user input. However, we don't yet have a way to react or respond to that input. For this we can use a different kind of structure called an __if/else statement__. These statements allow us to make decisions based on the value of a variable.\n\nThe basic structure of an `if/else` statement is:\n\n```JavaScript\n    if (condition) {\n        // code to run if condition is true\n    } else {\n        // code to run if condition is false\n    }\n```\n\nIf statements work like \"_If condition is met, then execute the task_\". In other words, the code in the `if` \"block\" will run if the `condition` (whatever it may be) is true and skip the `else` block, and the code in the `else` block will run if the `condition` is false and skip the initial `if` block. Note the beginning and ending curly braces `{}` surrounding each branch of the code: `if` and `else` always utilize curly braces, rather than semicolons. These braces always indicate a particular block of code and you will encounter them in many contexts.\n\nThe other new thing of note here is the text following the two forward slashes `//`: these are called __comments__. Comments are used to explain the code and are not executed by the computer. They are purely for human readers. As we continue to build more complex programs, we will often use comments to explain the code. Writing comments for yourself is an important way to make sure that you recall the purpose of the code you are writing if you return to it later. It also helps others reading your code to understand your intentions as well.\n\nLet's look at a more concrete example of an if/else statement, modifying our \"get the user's age\" program from above and seeing if they are legally eligible to vote (as far as age goes) in the U.S. Try running the code in the console below.\n\n```JavaScript\n    var userAge = prompt(\"How old are you?\");\n    userAge = parseInt(userAge);\n    if (userAge \u003e= 18) {\n        alert(\"You are legally old enough to vote in the U.S.\");\n    } else {\n        alert(\"You are not legally old enough to vote in the U.S.\");\n    }\n```\n\n\u003cJSTerminal /\u003e\n\nAfter gathering the user input and performing the conversion, we then use an `if/else` statement to determine if the user is old enough to vote (that is, we check to see if they are 18 years or older). \n\n## Else If Statements\n\nUsing `else if`, you can utilize as many statements as you want in your code to check as many conditions as you need. Try running the following example in the console:\n\n```JavaScript    \n    var userAge = prompt(\"How old are you?\");\n    userAge = parseInt(userAge);\n\n    if (userAge \u003e= 18) {\n        alert(\"You are legally old enough to vote and drive in the U.S.\");\n    } else if (userAge \u003e= 16) {\n        alert(\"You are not old enough to vote, but you are old enough to drive in the U.S.\");\n    } else {\n        alert(\"You are not legally old enough to vote or drive in the U.S.\");\n    }\n```\n\n\u003cJSTerminal /\u003e\n\nThe first `if` statement checks to see if the user is old enough to purchase vote. If they are, the `alert` message is displayed. If they are not, the second statement `else if` checks to see if they are at least able to drive. If they are, the `alert` message is displayed. If they are not, the final `else` statement displays the last `alert` message. The final `else` statement in a series is usually considered a default case or catchall to execute if none of the other `if/else` statements are true.\n\nAlong with testing as many conditions as you want, you can also run as many lines of code as you want in each block. You can even chain together a series of `if/else` statements. This is called __nesting__. For example:\n\n```JavaScript\nif (condition1){\n    // code to run if condition1 is true\n    if (condition2){\n        // code to run if condition2 is true\n        if (condition3){\n            // code to run if condition3 is true\n        } else {\n            // code to run if condition3 is false\n        }\n    } else {\n        // code to run if condition2 is false\n    }\n} else {\n    // code to run if condition1 is false\n}\n```\n\nAs you might be able to tell from just this example, too many nested `if/else` statements can be hard to read and hard to maintain, so try to keep them to a minimum whenever possible.\n\nTo help you understand how each block of this conditional cascade is structured, take a look at the diagram below:\n\n![if/else diagram](/images/if-else-diagram.png)\n\nThe arrows indicate the beginning (opening) and ending (closing) braces of a particular `if/else` statement. By matching the colors of each statement, you can see how the curly braces are continually nesting and designating their own blocks of code. While many modern code editors have their own built-in syntax highlighting (or coloring) as well as automatic indentation and bracing to make our code more visually understandable, it is still important to keep a close eye on your code and make sure you are following the correct structure and working in the correct block. \n\n## Switch Statements\n\nSwitch statements are another control flow structure used to handle multiple conditions. They are perhaps not as common, but they are useful to cover here briefly, as they can have a cleaner syntax than creating overly complex chains of `if/else` statements.\n\nThe basic structure of a switch statement is:\n\n```JavaScript\n    switch (variable) {\n        case value1:\n            // code to run if `variable` is `value1`\n            break;\n        case value2:\n            // code to run if `variable` is `value2`\n            break;\n        case value3:\n            // code to run if `variable` is `value3`\n            break;\n        default:\n            // code to run if `variable` is not `value1`, `value2`, or `value3`\n            break;\n    }\n```\n\nLike the `if/else` statement, the `switch` statement is broken into a series of `case` statements. Each `case` statement is a condition that the `switch` statement will check. The `switch` statement will then execute the code in the block that is associated with the first `case` statement that is evaluated as true. If none of the `case` statements are true, the `default` block will be executed.\n\nThe `break` statement is used to break out of the `switch` statement. The `break` statement is not required, but it is recommended to use it. If you omit the `break` statement, the `switch` statement will continue to execute the code in the next `case` statements even if they do not match the case.\n\nLet's take a look at a more concrete example of a `switch` statement. Let's say we were creating a computer game, and wanted to let the player pick a difficulty setting. Take a look at the following code and run it in the console:\n\n```JavaScript\n    var difficulty = prompt(\"What difficulty would you like to play? 1- Easy, 2- Medium, 3- Hard\");\n    switch (difficulty) {\n        case \"1\":\n            alert(\"You have selected the Easy difficulty.\");\n            break;\n        case \"2\":\n            alert(\"You have selected the Medium difficulty.\");\n            break;\n        case \"3\":\n            alert(\"You have selected the Hard difficulty.\");\n            break;\n        default:\n            alert(\"Invalid entry.\");\n            break;\n    }\n```\n\u003cJSTerminal /\u003e\n\nHere we have three different difficulty levels (although you can have as many levels or `cases` as you want in a `switch` statement). The first `case` statement checks to see if the user entered `1`, the second `case` statement checks to see if the user entered `2`, and the final `case` statement checks to see if the user entered `3`. If the user entered `1`, `2`, or `3`, the `alert` message is displayed. If the user entered anything else, the `default` block is executed and an error message is shown. \n\nWhile this simple example could also easily be written using `if/else` statements, in your programming journey there may be times when writing a `switch` statement is more appropriate than writing many unwieldy `if/else` statements. Did you notice how many less curly braces you had to keep track of when writing a `switch` structure? Readability is just as important as functionality in programming.\n\n## Choose Your Own Adventure\n\nNow that you have a better understanding of some basic control flow structures in JavaScript, it's time to put them to work creating a simple Choose Your Own Adventure game using `prompt` for input and `alert()` for output. Since our game is meant to be a piece of interactive fiction, we'll want to use a variable to track player choices, and perhaps also let the player input their name to personalize the game and get things started.\n\n```JavaScript\n    var playerName, playerChoice;\n\n    var playerName = prompt(\"What is your name?\");\n    alert(\"Welcome, \" + playerName + \"!\");\n```\n\nNext, we can begin adding our story. I am going to show you an example, but feel free to get creative and write a story of your own. For my example, I am going to adapt the first two lines of Fredric Brown’s short story “Knock,” written in 1948. These two lines are a complete story in themselves and are widely considered one of the shortest and yet most evocative horror/sci fi stories to date. In Brown’s story, the first two lines are as follows: \n\n\u003e “The last man on earth sat alone in a room.  There was a knock on the door.”\n\nI’m going to have some fun with this story and let the player decide what to do next. I will also modify the language a bit—because we are creating a Choose Your Own Adventure story, we want to use second person phrasing (you). So, my story will look rather like this:\n\n```JavaScript\n    alert(playerName + \", you are the last person on earth, sitting alone in a room. There is a knock on the door... What will you do?\");\n    playerChoice = prompt(\"Enter 1 to cautiously approach the door. Enter 2 to hide under the table.\");\n    if (playerChoice == \"1\"){\n        alert(\"Your hands are trembling as you approach the door. You pause a moment before it.\");\n    } else if (playerChoice == \"2\"){\n        alert(\"As you hide under the table you hear the doorknob rattling.\");\n    }\n    else {\n        alert(\"Invalid entry.\");\n    }\n```\n\nHere we have given the player two options by entering either `1` or `2` into the prompt. Now that we have their first options, we can add further options by nesting additional `if` statements:\n\n```JavaScript\n    if (playerChoice == \"1\"){\n        alert(\"Your hands are trembling as you approach the door. You pause a moment before it.\");\n        playerChoice = prompt(\"Enter 1 to bravely open the door. Enter 2 to look through the door's peephole.\");\n        if (playerChoice == \"1\"){\n            alert(\"You swing the door open with courageous gusto.\")\n        }\n        else if (playerChoice == \"2\"){\n            alert(\"You cautiously look through the peephole.

Enter 2 to get up and find a weapon to defend yourself with.\");\n        if (playerChoice == \"1\"){\n            alert(\"Whatever is at the door has now begun banging on it loudly.\");\n        }\n        else if (playerChoice == \"2\"){\n            alert(\"You quickly but quietly get up and look around. You see a broom in the corner of the room and wield it mightily.\");\n        }\n        else {\n            alert(\"Invalid entry.\");\n        }\n    }\n    else {\n        alert(\"Invalid entry.\");\n    }\n```\n\nOkay, now we have some additional options for the player to choose from, along with more error messages if they choose incorrectly. Putting it all together then, here is the story so far:\n\n```JavaScript\n    var playerName, playerChoice;\n\n    var playerName = prompt(\"What is your name?\");\n    alert(\"Welcome, \" + playerName + \"!\");\n\n    alert(playerName + \", you are the last person on earth, sitting alone in a room. There is a knock on the door... What will you do?\");\n    playerChoice = prompt(\"Enter 1 to cautiously approach the door. Enter 2 to hide under the table.\");\n    if (playerChoice == \"1\"){\n        alert(\"Your hands are trembling as you approach the door. You pause a moment before it.\");\n        playerChoice = prompt(\"Enter 1 to bravely open the door. Enter 2 to look through the door's peephole.\");\n        if (playerChoice == \"1\"){\n            alert(\"You swing the door open with courageous gusto.\")\n        }\n        else if (playerChoice == \"2\"){\n            alert(\"You cautiously look through the peephole. You make out a vague shape looming before the door.\")\n        }\n        else {\n            alert(\"Invalid entry.\");\n        }\n    } else if (playerChoice == \"2\"){\n        alert(\"As you hide under the table you hear the doorknob rattling.\");\n        playerChoice = prompt(\"Enter 1 to stay hidden under the table. Enter 2 to get up and find a weapon to defend yourself with.\");\n        if (playerChoice == \"1\"){\n            alert(\"Whatever is at the door has now begun banging on it loudly.\");\n        }\n        else if (playerChoice == \"2\"){\n            alert(\"You quickly but quietly get up and look around. You see a broom in the corner of the room and wield it mightily.\");\n        }\n        else {\n            alert(\"Invalid entry.\");\n        }\n    }\n    else {\n        alert(\"Invalid entry.\");\n    }\n```\n\nTry writing a short story of your own in the code editor below. (You can also copy/paste the code from mine if you want to see it in action.) __Note:__ If you are particularly fond of your story, feel free to copy and paste it in a document for use later! We'll learn how to work with local JavaScript files in a later lesson.\n\n\u003cCodeEditor language='JavaScript' height = '450px'\u003e\n\u003c/CodeEditor\u003e\n\nWhile this approach to creating a Choose Your Own Adventure program works, it is very clunky and quite hard to read. As we said before, simply using a bunch of nested `if/else` statements makes a program incredibly difficult to build and maintain. Also, if the player incorrectly inputs a number, this program simply exits rather than prompting them to try again. Thankfully, JavaScript has many tools to help us address these issues. As we continue to learn more about the language, we will learn to use more control flow structures and data types to make our programs more readable and maintainable. Specifically, in the next lesson we will begin learning about loops and how to use them to repeat blocks of code, iterate over a series of values, and make our programs more efficient overall.\n\n## Review Questions\n\nLet's review the concepts we have learned in this lesson.\n\n1. The `prompt()` function always returns a `string`.\n\n\u003cQuiz\u003e\n- True*\n- False\n\u003c/Quiz\u003e\n\n2. The code snippet below will throw errors or otherwise not work as intended. Why?

We will also learn to work with a very versatile new data type called `arrays`. To put these skills to work, at the end of the lesson we will create a simple library app that allows users to search for a book and see if it is located in the library's collection. \n\n## Arrays\n\nLet's begin by learning about the `array` data type. So far, you have encountered variables that only contain a single value. An array, in contrast, is a _series_ or a _collection_ of values stored in a single variable. The following is an example of four different arrays:\n\n```JavaScript\nvar myArray1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\nvar myArray2 = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e'];\nvar myArray3 = [true, false, true, false];\nvar myArray4 = [1, 2, 'dog', true, [1, 2, 3]];\n```\n\nCreating an array is just like other variable declarations you have seen, but the items it contains are always denoted by square brackets `[]`. An array can house any of the data types we have encountered so far. The first array, for example, contains a series of numbers, the second array contains a series of letters, and the third array contains a series of booleans. Arrays are very versatile and can also contain a mix of different data types, like in the fourth example. As you can see, this array even contains another array `[1, 2, 3]`!\n\nArrays are useful when you want to have a series of values that are easily accessible. Creating an individual variable for each of the values in the example above, for instance, would make your code very confusing and hard to work with.\n\nLet's look at how we can access the values in an array.\n\n## Accessing Values in an Array\n\nTo work with particular values in an array, we access its __index__. Values in an array are numbered starting from 0. The first value in an array is at index 0, the second value at index 1, and so on. Take a look at the example below:\n\n```JavaScript\nvar myArray = [1, 2, 'dog', true, [1, 2, 3]];\nalert(myArray[0]); // returns 1\n```\n\nWe access the index of an array by using the square brackets `[]` and the corresponding index number. The code snippet above will `alert` the value at index 0 of the array `myArray`. Remember, 0 is the _first_ value in an array, 1 is the _second_ value, and so on.\n\nTry using `alert` to display the value for each of the items from the example in the code editor below:\n\n\u003cCodeEditor language='JavaScript'\u003e\n    \u003c/CodeEditor\u003e\n\nAs you can see, when you access the value at index 4 (`myArray[4]`), you get the value `1, 2, 3`. Again, this is because the value at index 4 is an array itself.\n\n## Changing Values in an Array\n\nTo change the value at a particular index in an array, we use the same syntax. We use the square brackets `[]` and the index number to access the value, and then assign that index a new value.\n\n```JavaScript\nvar myArray = [1, 2, 'dog', true, [1, 2, 3]];\nmyArray[0] = 'cat';\nalert(myArray[0]); // returns 'cat'\n```\n\nIn this example, the value at index 0 (originally `1`) will be changed to `'cat'`.\n\n## Adding Values to an Array\n\nTo add a new value to the end of an array, we use the `push()` method. This method takes a single value and adds it to the end of the array.\n\n```JavaScript\nvar myArray = [1, 2, 'dog', true, [1, 2, 3]];\nmyArray.push('cat');\nalert(myArray[5]); // returns 'cat'\n```\n\nThis code adds the value `'cat'` to the end of the array `myArray`.\n\n## Removing Values from an Array\n\nTo remove a value from an array, we can use the `pop()` method. This method removes the last value in the array.\n\n```JavaScript\nvar myArray = [1, 2, 'dog', true, [1, 2, 3]];\nmyArray.pop();\nalert(myArray[4]);\n```\n\nTry running this code in the code editor below.\n\n\u003cCodeEditor language='JavaScript'\u003e\n    \u003c/CodeEditor\u003e\n\nOh no, we are now getting a message of `undefined`! But this is exactly what we intended to happen, because the `pop()` method removed the last value in the array. So, when we try to access it, JavaScript finds nothing there.\n\n## Splicing an Array\n\nIf we want to remove a range of values from an array or start at a particular index, we can use the `splice()` method. This method takes two parameters: the first parameter is the index number of the first value we want to start from and remove, and the second parameter is the number of values to remove in total.\n\n```JavaScript\nvar myArray = [1, 2, 'dog', true, [1, 2, 3]];\nmyArray.splice(0, 2);\nalert(myArray[0]); // returns 'dog'\n```\n\nIn this example, the first two values in the array `myArray` are removed (we start at index 0 and remove two values total). After the operation, the value at index 0 is now `'dog'`.\n\n## Determining the Length of an Array\n\nIt may not always be clear to you how many values are actually stored in a particular array at any given time, especially if it becomes very large or you are adding and removing a lot of elements. To determine the number of values in an array, we use the `length` property. The `length` property returns the number of values in an array. For example:\n\n```JavaScript\nvar myArray = [1, 2, 'dog', true, [1, 2, 3]];\nalert(myArray.length); // returns 5\n```\n\nWe utilize `length` by prefacing it with a `.` (dot). This is called _dot notation_, and indicates we are working with a __method__. We'll cover what exactly methods are in later lessons, but for now keep in mind you utilize `length` with a dot and the array you want to work with.\n\nAs you can see, `length` counts through the values in the array, so it will return 5. It is important to note here that `length` starts with 1, not 0, so although the last value in the array is at index 4, `length` will still return 5. Confusing, right? It is simply a quirk of the language to get used to, so keep it in mind when working with arrays.\n\nAs an example, if you want to access the last value in the array, you can use the `[length - 1]` syntax. This will always return the last value in the array:\n\n```JavaScript\nvar myArray = [1, 2, 'dog', true, [1, 2, 3]];\nalert(myArray[myArray.length - 1]); // returns [1, 2, 3]\n```\n\nThis is a useful way to access the last value in an array even when you don't know how many elements the array holds.\n\n## The sort() Method\n\nLet's take a look at one last method that we can use on arrays. The `sort()` method sorts an array in alphabetical order, and is particularly useful if you have an array of letters or strings:\n\n```JavaScript\nvar myArray = ['c', 'b', 'a', 'e', 'd'];\nmyArray.sort();\nalert(myArray); // returns ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']\n```\n\nYou can, however, also use the `sort()` method to sort an array in numerical order. For example:\n\n```JavaScript\nvar myArray = [2, 4, 3, 1, 5];\nmyArray.sort();\nalert(myArray); // returns [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n```\n\nThere are [many other methods](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_array_methods.asp) you can perform on arrays, and we have only scratched the surface here. But keep in mind that arrays are a powerful tool for storing and manipulating data. Let's now take a look at how we can loop through arrays to make our code more efficient.\n\n## Looping Through an Array\n\nWe have so far seen how we can access values in an array, and manipulate them in ways that are useful. But what if we want to do something with every value in an array? For instance, if we wanted to access every value in an array, it would be very tedious to write out the same code over and over, referencing each and every item:\n\n```JavaScript\nmyArray[0];\nmyArray[1];\nmyArray[2];\nmyArray[3];\n...\n```\n\nThankfully, we can do this in a more efficient way. Let's explore a new kind of technique called __looping__. Looping is a way to iterate through a structure and perform an action on each element.\n\n## The For Loop\n\nWhen you want to loop through an array, the most common way is with a `for` loop. This loop will __iterate__ or step through the array and execute a block of code for each value in the array.\n\nThe general structure of a `for` loop is as follows:\n\n```JavaScript\nfor (var i = 0; i \u003c array.length; i++) {\n    // do something\n}\n```\n\nTODO: Reverse logic, explain more clearly, add another example\n\nThis may look a little complicated, so let's explore it a bit. The `for` loop is comprised of three parts: the first part is the initialization of the loop, which is the variable `i` in this case (`i` is often used by convention, but the variable name can be anything you want). The second part is the condition that the loop will continue to execute until, and the third part is the incrementor. Each is separated by a semi-colon `;`.\n\nTo break it down a little more:\n- `var i = 0`: This is the starting point of the loop. It will serve as the index number of the first element in the array.\n- `i \u003c array.length`: This is the condition of the loop. It is a boolean expression that determines whether the loop should continue. In other words, it says: \"while `i` is less than the `length` of the array, do the following:\".\n- `i++`: This is the incrementor. `++` is a new operator that means that the value of `i` will increase or __increment__ by 1 each time the loop executes. We use it to increment the index number of the loop so that it will continually move to the next element in the array. \n\n Let's see how this works in action using our `myArray` array from earlier:\n\n```JavaScript\nvar myArray = [1, 2, 'dog', true, [1, 2, 3]];\nfor (var i = 0; i \u003c myArray.length; i++) {\n    alert(myArray[i]);\n}\n```\n\nTry running this code in the code editor below.\n\n\u003cCodeEditor language='JavaScript'\u003e\n    \u003c/CodeEditor\u003e\n\nAs you can see, the loop iterated through the array and alerted each value in the array. You'll notice that the loop executed the alert 5 times instead of displaying all the values at once. This is because the loop is executing the alert once for each value in the array. In other words, the code inside the `for` loop block executes once for each value in the array based on the current value of `i`. So, if there are 5 values in the array, the loop will execute 5 times.\n\n## The While Loop\n\nThe `while` loop is similar to the `for` loop, but it will infinitely execute the code inside a loop until a certain specified condition is met. This is useful if you want a certain code block to run until a particular outcome is resolved. Try running the example in the code editor below: \n\n```JavaScript\nvar i = 0;\nwhile (i \u003c 5) {\n    alert(i);\n    i++;\n}\n```\n\n\u003cCodeEditor language='JavaScript'\u003e\n    \u003c/CodeEditor\u003e\n\nAs you can see, the loop executed the alert 5 times, incrementing the value of `i` each time. In other words, this loop is saying: \"while `i` is less than 5, do the following:\".\n\n__Note:__ It is very important to make sure your `while` loops ultimately end by satisfying the condition you specify. If you don't, the loop will continue forever, and the user will be required to force-quit your program or close the window to stop it.\n\n## Putting It All Together - The Library App\n\nLet's use the skills we've learned in this lesson to create a simple app that will allow us to sort, display, and search for book titles from our library.\n\nTo begin, let's imagine a number of fiction titles that are available in our library and add them to an array. We'll sort this array to put it in alphabetical order.\n\n```JavaScript\nvar bookTitles = [\n    'Too Loud a Solitude',\n    'Things Fall Apart',\n    'The Master and Margarita',\n    'The Three Body Problem',\n    'The Woman Destroyed',\n    'Beloved',\n    'The Tenant of Wildfell Hall',\n    \"Lady Chatterley's Lover\",\n];\n\nbookTitles.sort()\nvar requestedTitle = \"\";\nvar libRequests = []\n```\n\nBecause we want to get book requests from the user, an empty string `requestedTitle` will store the title of the book that the user requested in the prompt, and an empty array `libRequests` will store all the many requests the user may enter.\n\nNext, let's give the user a short welcome message. We will also let them know they can make a request by typing `request` at the prompt, display all book titles by typing `display`, or quit the program by typing `quit`:\n\n```JavaScript\nalert(\"Welcome to the library!\\n\\nPlease search for a book title when prompted.\\n\\nType `request` at the prompt to make a request for a book.\\n\\nYou can also type `display` at the prompt to display all available book titles.\\n\\nType `quit` at the prompt to quit the program.\");\n```\n\nOur welcome message gives the user a few options for what they can do. To keep the text display neat, we use `\\n` characters (specifically 2 in this case) to create two new lines after each statement.\n\nAt this point, we can envision a few things about how our program should operate:\n- We want to allow the user to search for books until they decide to quit. So, a `while` loop will be needed.\n- We want to check if the user types `request` or `display` at the prompt. If they do, we want to perform the appropriate action. So, we will need several `if/else` statements. \n- We want to iterate through the array of book titles and display each one. So, we can use a `for` loop to accomplish this.\n\nOkay, conceptually we have the basic toolkit. However, we are missing one crucial piece. We want the program to check if a book title the user enters is actually in the library. That is, we want to see if the string the user enters matches an item in the array `bookTitles`. How can we do this? Let's introduce one more new method: `indexOf`.\n\n### indexOf\n\n`indexOf` is a method that returns the index of the first occurrence of a value in an array. If the value is not found, it will return `-1`. Here's an example:\n\n```JavaScript\nvar myArray = ['dog', 'cat', 'bird', 'fish'];\nmyArray.indexOf('dog'); // returns 0\nmyArray.indexOf('cat'); // returns 1\nmyArray.indexOf('bird'); // returns 2\nmyArray.indexOf('fish'); // returns 3\nmyArray.indexOf('cow'); // returns -1\n```\n\nUsing this method, we can check if a book title the user enters is in the library (if the string the user enters matches an item in the array `bookTitles`). If it doesn't (if the method returns `-1`), we can alert the user that the book they requested is not in the library.\n\nWith this method we should now have everything we need. Let's put the whole program together:\n\n```JavaScript\nvar bookTitles = [\n    'Too Loud a Solitude',\n    'Things Fall Apart',\n    'The Master and Margarita',\n    'The Three Body Problem',\n    'The Woman Destroyed',\n    'Beloved',\n    'The Tenant of Wildfell Hall',\n    \"Lady Chatterley's Lover\",\n];\n\nbookTitles.sort();\nvar libRequests = [];\nvar requestedTitle = \"\";\n\nalert(\"Welcome to the library!\\n\\nPlease search for a book title when prompted.\\n\\nType `request` at the prompt to make a request for a book.\\n\\nYou can also type `display` at the prompt to display all available book titles.\\n\\nType `quit` at the prompt to quit the program.\");\n\nvar response = \"\";\nwhile (response != 'quit') {\n    response = prompt(\"Search for a book title or make a request by typing 'request': \");\n    // check if the user wants to make a request\n    if (response == 'request') {\n        requestedTitle = prompt(\"What book would you like to request? \");\n        libRequests.push(requestedTitle); // add the requested title to the library requests array\n        alert(\"You have requested the following titles:\" + libRequests + \".\"); // alert the user their requests\n    }\n    // check if the user wants to display all the titles\n    else if (response == 'display') {\n        for (var i = 0; i \u003c bookTitles.length; i++) {\n            alert(bookTitles[i]); // display all available book titles\n            }\n    }\n    // otherwise, check if the book the user entered is in the library\n    else {\n        var bookIndex = bookTitles.indexOf(response);\n        if (response != 'quit'){\n            // if indexOf returns -1, the book the user entered is not in the library\n            if (bookIndex == -1) {\n                alert(\"Sorry, we don't have that book. You can always request it.\");\n            }\n            else {\n                alert(\"Yes, \" + response + \" is available to check out.\");\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nTry running and exploring the program:\n\n\u003cCodeEditor language='JavaScript'\u003e\n    \u003c/CodeEditor\u003e\n\nLet's break down the logic of the program a bit. First, we have a `var response = \"\";` line. This is an empty string variable declaration meant to store the user's response to the prompt. We will use this variable to determine whether or not the user wants to make a request, display, or quit, or else search for the book in our library. Next, we have a `while` loop that will continue to execute until the user types `quit`. Within the `while` loop, we first check if the user's response is `request` or `display`. If it is, we can perform the appropriate action using `if/else if` statements. To display all book titles, we use a `for` loop to alert each book. If the response is not a defined user action (i.e., request, display, quit), we can check if the string is in the library. We use the `indexOf` method to check if the `response` string is in the library. If it is, we can alert the user that the book is available to check out. If it isn't (if the method returns `-1`), we can alert the user that the book is not in the library.\n\nCongratulations! You have now successfully created a basic library search program. There are, of course, a number of limitations to this program. For instance: \n- The search parameters are not very robust. The user must type out the full title of the book, with the exact spelling and punctuation of the title. As you might imagine, this is not a very good user experience.\n- The `for` loop sends an alert for each book in the library. This is not ideal, especially if we had a large amount of books. We would want to display the books in a more organized manner.\n\nThese are basic considerations we would want to take into account if we were actually designing a library search program. However, if you can understand how this program works, you are well on your way to creating complex and robust JavaScript programs. To get some more practice in, try out the challenges below.\n\n## Review Questions\n\nLet's review the concepts we have learned in this lesson.\n\n1. What will be the result of the `alert` in the code below?\n\n```JavaScript\nvar myArray = [1, 2, 'dog', true, [1, 2, 3]];\nmyArray.pop();\nalert(myArray[4]);\n```\n\n\u003cQuiz\u003e\n- 1, 2, 3\n- true\n- undefined*\n\u003c/Quiz\u003e\n\n2. What will be the result of the `alert` in this code snippet?\n\n```JavaScript\nvar myArray = [1, 2, 'dog', true, [1, 2, 3]];\nalert(myArray.length);\n```\n\n\u003cQuiz\u003e\n- 4\n- 5*\n- 6\n\u003c/Quiz\u003e\n\n3. What will be the result of the `alert` here?\n\n```JavaScript\nvar myArray = [1, 2, 'dog', true, [1, 2, 3]];\nmyArray.splice(0, 2);\nalert(myArray[0]);\n```\n\n\u003cQuiz\u003e\n- 1\n- 2\n- dog*\n- true\n- [1, 2, 3]\n\u003c/Quiz\u003e\n\n## Challenges\n\n1. Write a `for` loop that prints all even numbers from 0 to 100 to the console.\n\n2. The library program is very case sensitive, requiring the user to enter exact punctuation and capitalization of a book title. This is not a very robust search. Try improving the program using the [toLowerCase method](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_tolowercase.asp), which converts all the letters of a string to lowercase, to make the search parameters case insensitive. _Hint: To match the two terms, you will want to perform the `toLowerCase` method both on the user's response as well as on each book title in the library. Try storing these results in new variables!_\n\n## Key Terms\n\nDo you recall the following terms from this lesson?\n- `array`\n- `index`\n- `length`\n- `push`\n- `pop`\n- `splice`\n- `sort`\n- `indexOf`\n\n# Functions\n\nIn the last lesson, we learned how to loop through a series of statements to repeat blocks of code. As you saw, this can be very useful if we want to automate a series of tasks that would otherwise take forever to write out manually. __Functions__ are another technique that can be used to repeat and reuse blocks of code and help us automate tasks. In this lesson, we will learn how to create our own functions and how to use them. To this end, at the bottom of the lesson we will create a simple grading program that will allow you to add, calculate, and display student grades.\n\n## What are Functions?\n\nFunctions are blocks of code that are designed to perform a specific task and can be reused. When developing applications, you will likely need to perform the same action in many different places. For example, you may need to perform a specific calculation on a number of different values and in different places in your code. Or, you might want to show an error message whenever an error occurs. Instead of rewriting the same code over and over again to perform these actions, you can wrap the code in a function and then call the function whenever you need to perform the action.\n\nThe basic syntax for creating a function is as follows:\n\n```JavaScript\nfunction functionName(parameter1, parameter2, ...) {\n    // code to be executed\n    return value;\n}\n```\n\nTo create a function, you must first define the function name. Naming conventions for functions are [lower CamelCase](https://wiki.c2.com/?LowerCamelCase), in which the first word is lowercase and the following words begin with a capital letter. Next, you define the function's __parameters__ or __arguments__ within closed parentheses `()`. The parameters are the values that will be __passed__ into the function when it is called. Passing in parameters allows us to reuse the same function for different tasks, because we can pass in different values to the function each time we want to reuse it. The parameters are separated by commas. You can define as many parameters as you want.\n\nLike loops, you can see that functions use curly braces to define their contents. The contents of the function are the code that will be executed whenever the function is called.\n\nFor a procedure to be designated a function, it will also __return__ a value. In other words, a function takes some input, transforms that input somehow, and returns an output. \n\nTo make this all clearer, let's look at a basic example of a function. We will create a function called `add` that takes two numbers as parameters and returns the sum of the two numbers.\n\n```JavaScript\nfunction add(num1, num2) {\n    return num1 + num2;\n}\n```\nFirst we define the function `add()` with two parameters to pass in, `num1` and `num2`. To add the two numbers we can simply return `num1 + num2`. Note that we could also have defined a variable `sum` and then returned `sum`, like so:\n\n```JavaScript\nfunction add(num1, num2) {\n    var sum = num1 + num2;\n    return sum;\n}\n```\n\nThis is functionally the same result. The only difference is that we have created a new variable within the function to store the sum.\n\n## Calling a Function\n\nIf you were to run the code above, you would see that nothing happens. This is because we have not __called__ the function yet. To call a function, we simply use the function name followed by parentheses. The parentheses contain the values that will be passed into the function. Let's try calling the `add()` function with two number values:\n\n```JavaScript\nfunction add(num1, num2) {\n    return num1 + num2;\n}\n\nadd(1, 2);\n```\n\nTry running this code in the editor below.\n\n\u003cCodeEditor language='JavaScript'\u003e\n    \u003c/CodeEditor\u003e\n\nAs you can see, the result of the `add()` function above returns 3 to the console. This is because `add()` takes two numbers as parameters and returns the sum of the two numbers. In this case, `num1` is 1 and `num2` is 2. If you change the values of `num1` and `num2` to different numbers, the result will also change. Again, this allows us to reuse the `add()` function to perform the same calculation on different values.\n\nWe could also capture the result of the function in a variable and then work with that variable. For example:\n\n```JavaScript\nfunction add(num1, num2) {\n    var sum = num1 + num2;\n    return sum;\n}\n\nvar result = add(1, 2);\nalert(result);\n```\n\nHere we are calling the `add` function and storing the result of the function (the return value) in the variable `result`. We can then use the variable to perform whatever action we want.\n\n__Note:__ Make sure you are passing in the correct number of parameters when calling a function (at least for functions you have created yourself. Built-in functions inherent to JavaScript can behave a little differently, but don't worry about that right now). If you call the function with too few parameters or too many parameters, your function will likely either behave in unexpected ways or throw an error.\n\nIt is worth pointing out that you can also call a function with no parameters and also without an explicit `return` statement. For example, we can create a function called `alertHello` that will simply alert \"Hello!\" to the user.\n\n```JavaScript\nfunction alertHello() {\n    alert('Hello!');\n}\n\nalertHello();\n```\n\nRunning this code will alert \"Hello!\" to the user.\n\nNote that if your code does not have a return statement or if the content does not return a value, JavaScript functions will automatically return `undefined`.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```JavaScript\nfunction doNothing() {\n    // do nothing\n}\n\ndoNothing();\n```\n\nIf you type this code into the developer console in your browser, you will see that the function returns `undefined` because you have not provided it with any return value.\n\nOkay, now that we have some basic understanding of how functions operate, let's look at how they create new \"scopes\" in your code.\n\n## Scope\n\nWhen you create a function, it designates a new __scope__. Scope is the context in which a particular variable is accessible. In other words, it means where a variable can be available for use (read, manipulated, displayed, etc.) in your code. Depending on how and where you declare your variables, you can have different scopes.\n\n### Rethinking Variable Declarations: `var` vs. `let` and `const`\n\nSo far in this course, we have used the `var` keyword to declare variables. While this was the old standard way of declaring variables in JavaScript, in most modern usages it has been replaced by the `let` and `const` keywords. `const` in particular has become the new standard for declaring variables in JavaScript. While you can see that the syntax is the same...\n\n```JavaScript\nvar name = 'John';\nlet age = 30;\nconst isAdmin = true;\n```\n\n...the behavior of the keywords is different. From now on, __we will shift to using the `let` and `const` keywords in this course, and in particular, to using `const`.__ What, then, are the differences between these variable declarations?\n\nTo understand the differences between these declarations, we need to understand their scope. Let's understand the scope of each of these types and see why `let` and especially `const` are the new standard.\n\n### `var`\n\n`var` declarations can be \"globally\" and \"function/locally\" scoped. Global scope means that the variable is available for use anywhere throughout your code. Function scope means that the variable is available for use only within the function it is defined. When declared outside of a function, `var` is global and can be accessed anywhere in your code. When declared inside of a function, `var` is function-scoped and can only be accessed within the function. Take a look at the example below:\n\n```JavaScript\nvar greet = \"hi there\";\n\nfunction newFunction() {\n    var hello = \"hello\";\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, `greet` is globally scoped because it exists outside of the function, while `hello` is function scoped. These variables have different levels of access. To see what I mean, try running the code below in the editor:\n\n```JavaScript\nvar greet = \"hey hi\"\n\nfunction newFunction() {\n    var hello = \"hello\";\n}\n\nconsole.log(greet); // this would work\nconsole.log(hello); // but this will not\n```\n\n\u003cCodeEditor language='JavaScript'\u003e\n    \u003c/CodeEditor\u003e\n\nAs you can see, the console trips up at the `console.log(hello);` and throws a `ReferenceError`, which states that '`hello is not defined`. This is because `hello` is only available _inside_ of the function in which it was declared. If you try to access `hello` outside of the function, JavaScript can't find the variable declaration you are referring to. In contrast, `greet` will correctly log the value of `greet` because it is globally scoped.\n    \nYou have also seen how `var` declarations are mutable, insofar as they can be re-declared and reassigned. You can change the value of a `var` at any time:\n\n```JavaScript\n// re-declaration\nvar greet = \"hi there\";\nvar greet = \"hello there\";\n\n// reassignment\nvar greet = \"hi there\";\ngreet = \"hello there\";\n```\n\nWhile this can be useful in some circumstances, it is not recommended. Once your programs become more complex, you may find yourself accidentally re-declaring or reassigning variables without realizing it. This can cause unexpected behavior and can be a source of bugs. This is a large part of why we will use the `let` and `const` keywords in the future instead of `var`, so let's discuss each of those keywords next.\n\n## `let`\n\nIn contrast to `var`, `let` declarations are block-scoped. This means that the variable is only available within the block of code in which it is declared. As you have seen, a block is a section of code surrounded by curly braces. So, a variable declared inside of a block with `let` is only available within that block. Try running the code below in the editor:\n\n```JavaScript\nlet someValue = 1;\n\nif (someValue \u003e 0) {\n    let greet = \"hi there\";\n    console.log(greet); // this will successfully log \"hi there\"\n}\n\nconsole.log(someValue); // this will successfully log 1\nconsole.log(greet); // but this throws a ReferenceError\n```\n\n\u003cCodeEditor language='JavaScript'\u003e\n    \u003c/CodeEditor\u003e\n\nWe can see that using `greet` outside of its block (the curly braces where it was defined) returns an error. Again, this is because `greet` is only available inside of the block in which it was declared. By contrast, `someValue` is available to display because it was declared within its own block outside of the function.\n\nJust like with `var`, you can reassign the values of `let` variables at any time. However, unlike `var`, you cannot re-declare a `let` variable. So while this will work:\n\n```JavaScript\n// reassignment\nlet greet = \"hi there\";\ngreet = \"hello there\";\n```\n\nThis will not:\n\n```JavaScript\n// re-declaration, will error\nlet greet = \"hi there\";\nlet greet = \"hello there\";\n```\n\nIf you try running the re-declaration code you will get a `SyntaxError` that says `\"Identifier 'greet' has already been declared\"`. Using `let` therefore solves the problem of accidentally re-declaring variables. \n\n__Note:__ While you cannot re-declare a `let` variable within the block is which it was declared, you _can_ re-declare a `let` variable _outside_ of the block in which it was declared:\n\n```JavaScript\nlet greet = \"hi there\";\nif (true) {\n    let greet = \"hello there\";\n    console.log(greet); // this will successfully log \"hello there\"\n}\nconsole.log(greet); // will successfully log \"hi there\"\n```\n\nDo you understand why this works? Because they are block-scoped, both `greet` variables are treated as _entirely different_ variables!\n\nAs you can see, `let` is an improvement over `var` in the sense that it can help you avoid accidentally modifying the value of a variable that you did not intend to modify. However, `const` has become the standard for many cases, so let's look at why.\n\n## `const`\n\nIn the rest of this course, we will often use `const` to declare variables. Like `let`, `const` is block-scoped. This means that the variable is only available within the block of code in which it is declared. However, unlike `let`, `const` variables are __immutable__. This means that once they are declared, they cannot be updated or re-declared. As you might have guessed, `const` is shorthand for \"constant.\" In other words, `const` is a way to declare variables that you will never want to modify.\n\nThe value of a `const` variable always remains the same within its scope. So, if we declare a `const` variable, we can't do any of the following:\n\n```JavaScript\n// reassignment\nconst greet = \"hi there\";\ngreet = \"wait, say hello there instead\"; // throws a TypeError\n\n// re-declaration\nconst greet = \"hi there\";\nconst greet = \"I really wish I could say hello there\"; // throws a TypeError\n```\n\nRunning this code would give you a `TypeError` saying `\"Cannot assign to constant variable\"`. This is because we are trying to change the value of a constant variable.\n\nOkay, now that we have a basic understanding of how scope in JavaScript works, let's move on to utilizing functions to create a simple grading program.\n\n## The Student Grades Program\n\nUsing functions, let's create a simple program that will allow us to evaluate student grades.\n\nLet's imagine that students have just submitted several homework assignments and we need to evaluate their grades. We want to:\n1. Easily display their grades.\n2. A new student has joined and submitted work, so we want to add a student to our list of students.\n3. Evaluate their numbered grades to a letter (A, B, C, D, or F).\n\nFunctions are perfect for this because we can define each of these three tasks as a separate function. We can then call each of these functions at the appropriate time. Remember, functions should be used to perform a _single_ defined task whenever possible.\n\n## Objects\n\nFor this program, we first need a way to store the information about each student. We want to store the name of each student as well as their corresponding grades. While we could solely use arrays to accomplish this, it makes much more sense to utilize a new data type called __objects__. \n\nObjects are similar to arrays, but they are more flexible. Objects are collections of _key-value_ pairs, and each key-value pair is called a _property_. In real life, all objects have properties. For example, a car has properties such as `make`, `model`, `year`, `color`, and so on. Analogously, we might imagine that a student has properties such as `name`, `grade`, `GPA`, and so on.\n\nTo create an object, we use the curly brace `{}` syntax. For example, we could create a student object with the following code:\n\n```JavaScript\nlet student = {\n    name: \"Bob\",\n    grade: \"A\",\n    GPA: 4.0\n};\n```\n\nHere we have a student object with three properties: `name`, `grade`, and `GPA`. Each key is followed by a colon `:` and the corresponding value. We separate each key-value pair (each property) with commas.\n\nTo access the value of a property, we use the `.` syntax with the key. For example, to log the properties of our `student` object, we could write:\n\n```JavaScript\nconsole.log(student.name); // logs \"Bob\"\nconsole.log(student.grade); // logs \"A\"\nconsole.log(student.GPA); // logs 4.0\n```\n\nAs you can see, objects very usefully allow us to associate a number of different properties with a single item.\n\nFor our purposes, we have many students rather than just one. How might we accomplish this? Well, we can create an array of objects! Let's try creating an array of student objects.\n\n```JavaScript\nlet students = [\n    {\n        name: \"Bob\",\n        grades: [88, 90, 80, 77, 89]\n    },\n    {\n        name: \"Alice\",\n        grades: [100, 95, 92, 89, 97]\n    },\n    {\n        name: \"Juan\",\n        grades: [91, 90, 94, 86, 90]\n    }\n];\n```\n\nHere we have an array of three student objects. Each student object has a `name` property and a `grades` property. The `grades` property is itself an array of numbers (5 different grades).\n\n### Printing the Grades\n\nNext, let's write a function to print all student names and their grades. Because we want to iterate through the array of student objects, we will use a `for` loop.\n\n```JavaScript\n// print all student names and their grades\nfunction printGrades(students) {\n    for (let i = 0; i \u003c students.length; i++) {\n        console.log(students[i].name + \": \" + students[i].grades);\n    }\n}\n\nprintGrades(students);\n```\n\nAs you can see, we are accessing the `name` and `grades` properties of each student object (using the `.` dot operator) and logging them as we loop through. By using `i` as our index, we are accessing each student object in the array.\n\n### Adding a Student\n\nA new student joined our class and submitted his work. So, let's add him to our array of students with a new `addStudent()` function.\n\n```JavaScript\nfunction addStudent(name, grades) {\n    let student = {\n        name: name,\n        grades: grades\n    };\n    students.push(student);\n}\n\naddStudent(\"Biff\", [71, 80, 56, 65, 60]);\n```\n\nIn the function, we are creating a new student object with `name` and `grades` properties to match the other students. We then add this object to the end of the `students` array using the `push` method. Finally, we call the function with the name and grades of the new student (poor Biff didn't do too well, sadly), which will add the values to the corresponding properties. If you were to run the `printGrades()` function now, you would see that the new student is included in the list of students.\n\n### Converting Grades to Letters\n\nLastly, let's create a function to convert all student grades to letter grades and print them: \n\n```JavaScript\nfunction convertGrades(students) {\n    for (let i = 0; i \u003c students.length; i++) {\n        let grades = students[i].grades;\n        let letterGrade = \"\";\n        for (let j = 0; j \u003c grades.length; j++) {\n            if (grades[j] \u003e= 90) {\n                letterGrade += \"A \";\n            } else if (grades[j] \u003e= 80) {\n                letterGrade += \"B \";\n            } else if (grades[j] \u003e= 70) {\n                letterGrade += \"C \";\n            } else if (grades[j] \u003e= 60) {\n                letterGrade += \"D \";\n            } else {\n                letterGrade += \"F \";\n            }\n        }\n        console.log(students[i].name + \": \" + letterGrade);\n    }\n}\n\nconvertGrades(students);\n```\n\nThis function is slightly more complicated, because we need to iterate _both_ through the `students` array and each student's `grades` array, and evaluate the latter numbers to a letter grade. We can accomplish this by using two `for` loops: a `for` loop to iterate through the `students` array (using `i` and `students.length`), and a nested `for` loop to iterate through each student's `grades` (using `j` and `grades.length`). As we work through each student object, we first store the grades values of each student in a variable `grades`. Because `grades` is itself an array of values, we can use the `.length` property to determine the number of grades for each student (5). We then use the `if` statement to determine the letter grade for each number, and add it to the `letterGrade` variable with the `+=` operator (with an extra space at the end to make it more readable).\n\nLet's put the whole program together:\n\n```JavaScript\n// array of student objects\nlet students = [\n    {\n        name: \"Bob\",\n        grades: [88, 90, 80, 77, 89]\n    },\n    {\n        name: \"Alice\",\n        grades: [100, 95, 92, 89, 97]\n    },\n    {\n        name: \"Juan\",\n        grades: [91, 90, 94, 86, 90]\n    }\n];\n\n// print all student names and their grades\nfunction printGrades(students) {\n    for (let i = 0; i \u003c students.length; i++) {\n        console.log(students[i].name + \": \" + students[i].grades);\n    }\n}\n\n//add a new student\nfunction addStudent(name, grades) {\n    let student = {\n        name: name,\n        grades: grades\n    };\n    students.push(student);\n}\n\n// convert grades to letters\nfunction convertGrades(students) {\n    for (let i = 0; i \u003c students.length; i++) {\n        let grades = students[i].grades;\n        let letterGrade = \"\";\n        for (let j = 0; j \u003c grades.length; j++) {\n            if (grades[j] \u003e= 90) {\n                letterGrade += \"A \";\n            } else if (grades[j] \u003e= 80) {\n                letterGrade += \"B \";\n            } else if (grades[j] \u003e= 70) {\n                letterGrade += \"C \";\n            } else if (grades[j] \u003e= 60) {\n                letterGrade += \"D \";\n            } else {\n                letterGrade += \"F \";\n            }\n        }\n        console.log(students[i].name + \": \" + letterGrade);\n    }\n}\n\n// call functions\naddStudent(\"Biff\", [71, 80, 56, 65, 60]);\nprintGrades(students);\nconvertGrades(students);\n```\nTry running the program below in the editor and seeing the result in the browser's developer console.\n\n\u003cCodeEditor language='JavaScript' \u003e\n     \u003c/CodeEditor\u003e\n\n*Congratulations*, you have now created a simple grading program utilizing functions!\n\nFunctions are a great way to keep your code organized and readable. They are mainly used to create reusable pieces of code that can be employed in multiple places in your program. Remember that functions should ideally always be used to perform a _single_ task, and that their names should be descriptive of the task they are performing.\n\n## Review Questions\n\nLet's review the concepts we have learned in this lesson.\n\n1.

Especially when you are first beginning, it is easy to create errors and to write code that acts erratically or doesn't work at all. In fact, we have already made a few mistakes in previous lessons to illustrate the problems that can arise when learning to work with a new programming language. However, you should be aware that even the most seasoned professional programmers make mistakes as well. Coding can be a frustrating, laborious task at times, and dealing with errors and bugs is a constant process. However, I think you'll also find that coming up with creative ways to address issues that arise in your code can also be a great source of satisfaction.\n\nThankfully, programmers have developed many tools and strategies to help us deal with errors. In this lesson, we will cover a variety of tools, techniques, and strategies to help you write cleaner code, avoid common programming errors and pitfalls, and generally feel more confident in your ability to address problems.\n\nFirst, let's jump into some common error types and their causes.\n\n## Common Types of Errors\n\n### Syntax Errors\n\nYou may have noticed that JavaScript is a finnicky language. One errant `{` can cause your entire program to break. For all their usefulness, computers are not (yet) very good at discerning meaning or understanding implicit intentions. You must speak to them in a highly specific way for them to understand what you are trying to achieve. \n\nWhen writing JavaScript, the most common type of error to make is a __syntax error__. These errors arise when you fail to add or misspell an element of the language that is needed for the code to be understood. For instance, below is an example of a basic syntax error. Can you identify the error? Try running it in the code editor to see the result.\n\n```JavaScript\nconst oops = 12;\nif (oops == 12 {\n    alert(oops)\n}\n```\n\n\u003cCodeEditor language=\"JavaScript\"\u003e\n    \u003c/CodeEditor\u003e\n\nAs you can see, we get the message of `SyntaxError: Unexpected token '{'`. In other words, it is telling us that the first curly brace seems out of place. Why? Well, looking closely you'll notice that we did not close the parentheses `)` in the `if` statement, as JavaScript expected us to. Instead, it found a curly brace and didn't know what to do with it. \n\nWhen dealing with syntax errors, it is often best to use the error message JavaScript gives you to try and pinpoint where the error might be located. In this example, for instance, the curly brace _is_ where it should be, but is still described as \"unexpected.\" From this you can guess that you are likely missing something immediately before it.\n\nMany code editors nowadays (including VSCode, which we'll begin to work with in the next lesson) have built-in tools that will detect and alert you to syntactical mistakes you are making while writing your code. Syntax errors will inevitably happen, though, so when you see them arise make sure to take a careful look over what you've written for typos or missing elements.\n\n### Type Errors\n\n__Type errors__ are when you try to perform an operation on a value of the wrong type. For instance, below is an example of a type error. Can you identify what is causing the error? Try running it in the code editor to see the result.\n\n```JavaScript\nlet num = 1;\noops = num.toUpperCase();\nconsole.log(oops);\n```\n\n\u003cCodeEditor language=\"JavaScript\"\u003e\n    \u003c/CodeEditor\u003e\n\nIn this example, we are trying to use the `toUpperCase` method on a number. However, `toUpperCase` is only available for strings. You can only uppercase text! Hence the `TypeError` message. \n\nThis error gives us a direct clue for how to fix our code. We would first need to convert the number to a string. For instance, we could use the `toString` method:\n\n```JavaScript \nlet num = 1;\nfixed = num.toString().toUpperCase();\nconsole.log(fixed);\n```\n\nHere we apply both the `toString` and `toUpperCase` methods to the number, which then allows us to use it as an uppercase string. Note that you can chain methods together to accomplish tasks like this.\n\nIf, for whatever reason, you are ever in doubt about the particular type of a value, remember that you can use the `typeof` operator to check its type. This is a useful tool for figuring out where you might be going wrong.\n\n### Reference Errors\n\nWhen your programs begin to get more complex, it is occasionally difficult to discern what particular scope you are working within. This can cause programs to throw a __Reference Error__. Take a look at the example below. Can you identify what is causing the error? Try running it in the code editor to see the result.\n\n```JavaScript\nlet someValue = 1;\n\nif (someValue \u003e 0) {\n    let oops = \"blah blah\";\n    console.log(oops);\n}\n\nconsole.log(someValue);\nconsole.log(oops); \n```\n\n\u003cCodeEditor language=\"JavaScript\"\u003e\n    \u003c/CodeEditor\u003e\n\n\nAs you can see, we receive the message of `ReferenceError: oops is not defined`. This is telling us that we are trying to use the `oops` variable out of the scope in which it was declared. Always be sure to check the scope of your variables before using them.\n\n## Logical Errors\n\n__Logical errors__ occur where your syntax is actually correct but the code is not producing what you intended. In other words, the program runs successfully, but gives \"incorrect\" results. These are often harder to fix than other types of errors, as there usually isn't an explicit error message to direct you to the source of the error.\n\nTake a look at this example. It is a perfectly valid and legal code snippet, but won't work as intended. Can you identify where it is going wrong? Try running it in the code editor to see the result.\n\n```JavaScript\nfunction getPassword(){\n  let correct = \"password\";\n  let guess = \"\";\n  while (guess == correct) {\n    guess = prompt(\"What is the password?\");\n  }\n  alert(\"You may enter.\");\n}\n\ngetPassword();\n```\n\n\u003cCodeEditor language=\"JavaScript\"\u003e\n    \u003c/CodeEditor\u003e\n\nAs you can see, this is not a very good password system. In fact, it lets everyone have access immediately! To correct this, we would need to change the `==` operator to `!=`, to make sure the `while` loop runs only until the correct password is entered.\n\nThis is a fairly straightforward example, but for larger pieces of software logical errors can be much more complex and difficult to identify. Let's discuss some general strategies to help you deal with logical errors.\n\n## Strategies to Avoid Mistakes\n\nBelow are some general strategies and best practices you can follow to help you think through the structure and design of your programs.\n\n### Writing Pseudo-code\n\nOne common mistake for beginners in approaching code and coding problems is trying to solve a problem entirely in JavaScript. While this may seem like an obvious and commonsense approach, it is actually not always the best way to tackle a problem. Often, when creating complex programs, it is often useful to flesh out the structure and logic of your program before even writing any code or when faced with a seemingly unsolvable problem.\n\nThis practice is called __pseudo-coding__. Pseudo-code is an amalgamation of code-like expressions and regular English (or whatever natural language you are most comfortable with). There's no correct way to write pseudo-code--you make it up as you go along. As long as it looks a little bit like code and follows the same general pattern and procedure, you're doing well.\n\nThe reason we write pseudo-code is that it allows us to flesh out the logic of the program in a clear and accessible way. We use it to skip over unnecessary details in a way that we can easily convert into code later.\n\nHere's a possible example of pseudo-code for our simple password program from before:\n\n```\ncreate function get password\n    store correct password in variable\n    prompt user for password\n    while password is incorrect\n        prompt for password\n    alert user they may enter\n    end function\n```\n\nAs you can see, pseudo-code is a lot more readable than writing actual code. It provides you with an accessible blueprint of a program's logic and structure that you can then overlay or follow with actual code.\n\nAs mentioned, there is no one way to write pseudo-code. You can be as detailed or as abstract as you'd like. As long as you are clarifying the structure of your program to yourself (and others you may be collaborating with), it is sufficient. It is often best, however, to write pseudo-code that more or less matches the syntax and vocabulary of JavaScript.\n\nWhenever you are beginning a new program, it is highly recommended to write pseudo-code first. Not only will it make the overall structure of your program more intelligible, but it will also help you to avoid making logical errors down the road.\n\n### General Tips\n\nHere are some more general tips for dealing with logical errors:\n\n1. Understand what your code is doing step by step.\n\nWith a logical error, code behavior is unpredictable. A loop may never happen, it may never end, or it might sometimes work right and sometimes not. The key to finding logic errors is to predict why the code is doing what it's doing and why it's not doing what you want. Follow through your code step by step, identifying _key changes of behavior_. \n\n2. Form a hypothesis or two before looking at the code. \n\nThink about what is wrong before you look over the code. Try to describe in plain English (or etc.) what is going wrong. Go through this process before you look at code because the moment you see code, you'll start worrying about details rather than thinking about the bigger picture. Logic errors are almost always about _logic_, and no amount of staring at code will show you the error, nor will a debugger spot it for you.\n\n3. Resolve syntax errors.\n\nGo to the console and see if there are any syntax errors. If so, resolve them. Logic errors will not appear until you've resolved all syntax errors. If your code shows no syntax errors but still doesn't work correctly, you've got a logic error.\n\n4. Identify key variables or conditions.\n\nMost logic errors are centered around a condition that's not working right, and conditions are usually based on variables. Begin by taking a careful look at the conditions that control the behavior you're concerned about.\n\n5. Think about your logic.\n\nLogical errors aren't about getting the vocabulary right (remember, those are syntax errors). Logic errors are about telling the computer to do the wrong thing. The computer only does precisely what you tell it to do, so think hard about the logic you've applied and how you might be able to revise it.\n\n## Using console.log() to Debug\n\nTo keep things simple, we have been console.logging a lot of our programs just so we can see an immediate result. However, `console.log()` is best used for debugging purposes in your programs. It is a quick and easy way to see the current state of a particular variable or condition. If you are ever uncertain about what result you might get from a particular piece of code, or if it is giving you an error or an otherwise unintended value, try breaking down the code step by step and using `console.log()` to see what is going on at each point.\n\nKeep in mind that `console.log()` is useful no matter the data type: for instance, if you pass in an array, you'll be able to inspect the array's contents. Pass in an object, you can examine the object's attributes/methods. Pass in a string, it'll log the string. A good first step in any debugging process is to see exactly what you're getting back from the code. Pairing `console.log()` with `typeof` can also be particularly effective. Usually, this will give you some insight into what is going wrong.\n\n\n## Review Questions\n\n1.

Let's say you are writing a program that allows users to manage a collection of recipes. You want the user to be able to add, remove, edit, and search through their recipes. You also want the user to be able to \"favorite\" individual recipes and let them search and look through their list of favorites. Write some pseudo-code for a program that allows for each of these features.\n\n## Key Terms\n\n- syntax error\n- type error\n- reference error\n- logical error\n- pseudo-code\n\n# VSCode and GitHub \n\nUp to this point we have been working entirely in the browser and our work has faded into the past at every screen refresh. Ephemerality is not a feature much appreciated in programming. So, to get started on something more permanent, let's set up a practice folder to hold our code. Call it `javascript`, or whatever you want, as long as you promise to remember it. Throughout the rest of this course, we will be working in this folder. \n\nClick this button to download a couple of files we'll be needing. Unzip the folder and add the files to your working folder.\n\n\u003cDownload files='index.html, script.js'\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\n\nNext, we'll want to get our coding environment set up. This will be the main focus of this particular lesson. We'll first install the VSCode code editor, and then learn how to set up and use a GitHub repository.\n\nMuch of your academic career has likely been structured around sending in single documents. For instance, a .pdf or Word document of your latest essay masterpiece. In general, however, going forward in this class you'll want to think of your work in terms of a __project__, which is a collection of files and code that you want to work on. In the coding environment we'll set up and the project we'll create, we'll be working with many files that will all contribute to the same overall project. A website, for instance, is a project, made up of many different files. What we will end up building by the end of this course will all be housed in the same folder and will be managed though a single GitHub repository. This will hopefully make more sense once we get into it.\n\nFor now, let's go ahead and install VSCode.\n\n## VSCode\n\nVSCode is a free and open-source code editor that is available for Windows, Mac, and Linux. It is a great tool for developers to use when they are working on code. It supports syntax highlighting, code completion, has built-in GitHub integration, and has an large library of extensions that can be used to extend its functionality.\n\n### Installing VSCode\n\nNavigate to the [homepage of VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and download the appropriate version for your operating system (stable version).\n\n![VSCode homepage](/images/vscode_homepage.png)\n\nOnce it is installed, open up the application. On the left sidebar, you'll see a few different options. Let's look at three of them:\n\n![VSCode sidebar](/images/vs_code_sidebar.png)\n\n- The Explorer Window is the main window that you'll be working with. It is the main way to navigate through your project and to interact with files.\n- The Search Window is a window that you can use to search for files or words throughout your project.\n- The Source Control Window will allow you to manage your project's files and code through GitHub integration.\n\nThese are the main windows you'll be working with, along with the main code editor area, in which you'll be writing code.\n\n### Opening a Project\n\nFor now, go ahead and open up the Explorer Window and click Open Folder. Navigate to your working folder for the course, select the folder, and click Select Folder.\n\nIn the Explorer, you should now be able to view both the `index.html` file and the `script.js` file, and can open them to view the code for each file.\n\n![New Project](/images/vscode_openproject.png)\n\nNext, let's go ahead and initialize a Git repository for our project.\n\n## Creating a GitHub Account\n\nThe first step we'll need to take is to set up a GitHub account. Navigate to the [GitHub homepage](https://github.com/) and click \"Sign Up for GitHub\". You'll be prompted to create a new account.\n\n![GitHub Sign Up](/images/github_homepage.png)\n\n __Note:__ Although you don't have to, it is best to use your student email account (.edu) to register with GitHub, as this will allow you access to some features you otherwise would have to pay for.\n\n Work through the steps to create a new account and return here when you are finished.  \n\n## Getting Acquainted with Git and GitHub\n\nNow that you have a GitHub account, let's go ahead and initialize a repository (folder) for our project. \n\nFirst, we should understand a little about how Git and Github work. __Git__ is a _version control system_ that allows you to track changes to your files. If you have used \"track changes\" in the past with either Microsoft Word or Google Docs, you're likely familiar with the terminology. In effect, you are tracking all of the \"versions\" or life-histories of your files stored in the repository.\n\n__GitHub__ is an online platform for hosting Git repositories. It functions for some, predominantly programmers, as a social network for sharing and collaborating on code-based projects. Users can share their own projects, as well as search for others, which they can then often work on and contribute to. Digital Humanists, librarians, and other academics are also finding ways Git and GitHub are useful in writing projects and teaching.\n\nA [study of how Digital Humanists use GitHub](https://digitalscholarship.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/spirosmithdh2016githubpresentationfinal.pdf), conducted by Lisa Spiro and Sean Morey Smith, found that a wide range of users, including professors, research staff, graduate students, IT staff, and librarians commonly used the site in their DH work. They used GitHub for a diverse range of activities, such as:\n\n- Developing software\n- Sharing data sets\n- Creating websites\n- Writing articles and books\n- Collating online resources\n- Keeping research notes\n- Hosting syllabi and course materials\n\nAlthough it has many benefits, using Git and GitHub effectively does take a bit of practice. It is notorious for being a bit of a pain in the neck (leading to such websites as [Oh Shit, Git!](https://ohshitgit.com/)), but it is worth the effort.\n\n## Initializing a Git Repository on GitHub\n\nGit, as a version control system, can be enabled in a folder, and then used to save the state of the contents in that folder at different points in the future. It will also keep a record of all changes made in the past. It knows exactly when a file is added to a project and even when it is deleted. It can even resurrect files that have been deleted, if needed.\n\nLet's go ahead and initialize a Git repository for our project. In VSCode, click on the Source Control Window and click on the `Initialize Repository` button.\n\n![Initialize Repository](/images/vscode_initgit.png)\n\nYou should now be able to see the following:\n\n![Initial Commit](/images/vscode_gitcommit.png)\n\nIn Git, every change you make to a file and submit to version control is called a __commit__. A commit is effectively a snapshot of a file or files at a certain point in time. Every commit also has a __commit message__, which is a short description of what the commit is all about, either for yourself or for others you are collaborating with. You should write a brief, descriptive message that encapsulates the changes you have made at that point in time.\n\nLet's go ahead and make our first commit. In VSCode, type \"First commit\" in the message window and click `Commit`.\n\nYou should receive a message that `There are no staged changes to commit`. \n\n![No Staged Changes](/images/vscode_nostaged.png)\n\nThis is because we haven't made any changes to any files yet and because we haven't __staged__ any files yet. Before making a commit, you need to add the files to the \"staging environment\". Staged files are those that are ready to be committed. This will make more sense later as we continue to work with Git.\n\nFor now, go ahead and click `Yes` to the prompt.\n\nAfterwards, you should see a button updated to `Publish Branch`.\n\n![Publish Branch](/images/vscode_publishbranch.png)\n\nGo ahead and click Publish Branch. You should be prompted to sign into GitHub. Go ahead and click `Allow`, and sign in to GitHub with your account.\n\nIf you receive a message to `Authorize VSCode`, click Authorize.\n\n![Authorize VSCode](/images/github_authorize.png)\n\nIf you are given additional messages to allow VSCode to access your account, click through to allow.\n\nLastly, you will want to give your repository a name. In VSCode at the top, you should see a text field window for typing the name of your repository. Give it whatever name you want, and click `Publish to public repository`. You can also create private repositories, but for this class we will make our repositories public.\n\nAfterwards, you should see a message that says `Successfully published to GitHub` in the lower right corner of VSCode. (If you also receive a message to `periodically run git fetch`, you can just say no for now.)\n\n![Successfully Published](/images/github_published.png)\n\nIf you click through to `Open in GitHub`, you should be able to see the repository you just created, along with a message of your first commit.\n\n![New Repository](/images/github_new_repository.png)\n\nCongratulations! You have successfully created a new GitHub repository for this course.\n\nLet's go ahead and explore our files a bit, make a new change, and make a new commit to our repository.\n\n## Exploring our Files\n\nBack in VSCode, open up the Explorer Window and click on the `index.html` file. \n\n![index.html](/images/index_scrn.png)\n\nThis is an HTML file. It contains the code for the page that we will be working with. We will learn more about HTML in the next lesson.\n\nNow open the `script.js` file. As you can tell by the file extension (`.js`), this is a JavaScript file. It contains the code for the JavaScript that we will be working with.\n\nAs a project, each of these files is contributing to the webpage. We will learn more about how later, but for now let's look at the webpage in your browser.\n\nIn your file system, (not in VSCode), navigate to your folder containing these two files and double-click the `index.html` file to open it in your browser.\n\nYou should see the following:\n\n![Hey it worked!](/images/heyitworked.png)\n\nIf you reference both files in VSCode, you can see that text from each is being reflected on the webpage. In the HTML file, we are displaying `This is my project!`. In the JavaScript file, we are providing an alert that says `Hey it worked!`.\n\n### Making a Change\n\nWithout worrying about the HTML for now, let's change the `Hey it worked!` message to `My project is going to be awesome!`. Go ahead and make the change in your code editor.\n\nIf you save the file now, you should see a new change being registered in the source control window.\n\n![Second Commit](/images/second_commit.png)\n\nThe number 1 in the source control icon indicates that there is one file change. If you click on it, you can see that it is tracking all the changes made to the file. The little `M` next to the file name indicates that the file is modified. \n\n### Staging our Change\n\nYou can also see a `+` (plus) sign next to the file name, which allows you to __stage__ a change for commit. Go ahead and click it. You should now see a section that says `Staged Changes`.\n\n![Staged Changes](/images/staged_changes.png)\n\n### Committing our Change\n\nNow that we have staged our change, let's go ahead and commit our change. Be sure to type a message for the commit, like `Second Commit`.\n\n### Pushing our Changes to GitHub\n\nYou should now see a button that says `Sync Changes`. In the lingo of Git, this is called __pushing__ your changes. It is a way to send your changes to the remote repository on GitHub. Simply committing your changes will _not_ make the changes on your remote repository until you push them. Let's go ahead and click `Sync Changes` and click `Ok`to the prompt.\n\nIf you navigate to your repository in GitHub, you should see a new commit with the message `Second Commit`.\n\n![New Commit](/images/github_secondcommit.png)\n\nCongratulations! You have successfully pushed your changes to GitHub.\n\nUsing Git and GitHub might take a little getting used to, but it is a valuable resource for maintaining, sharing, and collaborating on projects. \n\nTo wrap up, keep in mind that the general process for working with Git is as follows:\n1. Make Changes\n2. Stage modified files\n3. Commit files with message\n4. Push to remote repository on GitHub\n\n## Review Questions\n\n1. A version control system like Git allows you to (select all that apply):\n\n\u003cQuiz\u003e\n- track changes to your files*\n- share your files and collaborate with others*\n- restore files you may have deleted on your own machine*\n- undo changes and revert to earlier versions*\n\u003c/Quiz\u003e\n\n2. True or False - You need to stage your files before committing them.\n\n\u003cQuiz\u003e\n- True*\n- False\n\u003c/Quiz\u003e\n\n3. True or False - If you commit your changes, they will be immediately reflected in your GitHub repository.\n\n\u003cQuiz\u003e\n- True\n- False*\n\u003c/Quiz\u003e\n\n## Challenge\n\nWe saw that both the HTML file and the JavaScript file are contributing to the creation of our project webpage. For this challenge, try changing the text that is displayed from the HTML page to whatever you'd like. Once you have made a change and see it reflected in the webpage, stage the change, commit it, and push it to GitHub with an appropriate message.\n\n## Key Terms\n\nDo you recall the meaning of the following terms?\n\n- Git\n- GitHub\n- stage\n- commit\n- push\n\n# HTML and CSS\n\nIn the last lesson we set up our project and created a repository on GitHub. Now that we have the environment set up and some files to work with, let's begin learning about writing HTML and CSS to modify a webpage. \n\nWe will be refreshing the page a lot, so the first thing I recommend doing is opening your `script.js` file in VSCode and commenting out `//` the alert that says `My project is going to be awesome!` so it doesn't become as much of an annoyance.\n\n```JavaScript\n// alert('My project is going to be awesome!');\n```\n\nTo start us off and provide some context for this lesson, let's understand a bit about how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript work together.\n\n## HTML, CSS, and JavaScript\n\n__HTML__ stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is the standard language used to define the _structure and content_ of a particular webpage. It allows you to add text, images, and other elements to a webpage, and to direct the overall layout of the webpage. For example, you can use HTML to add a header to your webpage, structure text in a series of paragraphs, add a table, a list of bullet points, an image, and much, much more. \n\nHTML works in tandem with __CSS__, which defines the _style_ of a webpage. CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. While HTML directs the overall structure and content of a page, CSS is used to define the particular _stylistic or aesthetic appearance_ of the page. For example, you can use CSS to define the color of text, the font, the size, the background color, the color of elements like buttons, and much more. While you could create a webpage entirely using HTML, it would ultimately be a boring, uninteresting webpage with a white background and black Times New Roman text. This is precisely where CSS comes in.\n\nBoth HTML and CSS can also work in tandem with JavaScript files. While HTML and CSS direct the structure and style of a page, JavaScript allows you to add _functionality_ to a webpage. For example, you could use JavaScript to add a button that says \"Click Me!\" and when the button is clicked, it will display an alert that says \"Hey! A button was clicked!\". In other words, whatever the user can interact with on a webpage is controlled by JavaScript.\n\nIt's worth noting that the three languages are intertwined, and that you can write CSS and JavaScript inside an HTML file. This will make more sense as we continue learning.\n\nIn general, just keep in mind that:\n- HTML provides the _structure_ of a webpage.\n- CSS provides the _style_ of a webpage.\n- JavaScript provides the _functionality_ of a webpage.\n\nWith this in mind, let's go ahead and dive into the basics of HTML.\n\n## HTML\n\nSo far, we have one HTML file to work with in our project: `index.html`. You can tell it is an HTML file by the `.html` extension. The name of the file (index) is an industry standard, because web browsers tend to recognize the index.html page as the opening page to your website directory. See [here](https://www.thoughtco.com/index-html-page-3466505) for more explanation.\n\nLet's take a look at the contents of the file. Open your project in VSCode and open the `index.html` file. You should see the following code display:\n\n```html\n\u003c!doctype HTML\u003e\n\u003chtml lang=\"en\"\u003e\n  \u003chead\u003e\n    \u003cmeta charset=\"utf-8\"\u003e\n    \u003ctitle\u003eMy JavaScripting Master's Student Project\u003c/title\u003e\n  \u003c/head\u003e\n  \u003cbody\u003e\n    \u003ch1\u003eThis is my project!\u003c/h1\u003e\n    \u003cscript src=\"script.js\"\u003e\u003c/script\u003e\n  \u003c/body\u003e\n\u003c/html\u003e\n```\n\nThis is a standard layout for a basic HTML page. The first thing you'll probably notice is that HTML elements are defined by the `\u003c` and `\u003e` characters. Some tags need both opening and closing tags, like `\u003ch1\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e`, while others only need one tag, like `\u003cmeta\u003e`. Tags that are self-closing, or don't require closing tags, are called _void elements_. To close a tag when needed, add a `/` before the name of the element in the last tag.\n\nLet's break down some of the specific elements we are seeing here. The first element is a `\u003c!doctype\u003e` tag. This tag is used to define the type of document that is being created: in this case, an HTML doc. We also see an `\u003chtml\u003e` tag after. This tag begins the HTML document proper.\n\nWe also have a `\u003chead\u003e` tag. This element is where we put all of the background information, or _metadata_, about the webpage. None of this information is actually visible in a webpage except for the `\u003ctitle\u003e` tag, which will be displayed as the title of the page in your browser's title bar.\n\nNext, we have the `\u003cbody\u003e` tag. This tag begins the body of the webpage, where we put all of the actual content we want to display. In this case, we have a `\u003ch1\u003e` tag. This tag defines a header, or a large series of text, and it has a text content of `\"This is my project!\"`. For the moment, let's skip the `\u003cscript\u003e` tag--we'll discuss that later in the lesson. We end the HTML document by closing the `\u003c/body\u003e` and `\u003c/html\u003e` tags.\n\nIn general, then, the basic template for any HTML document is as follows:\n\n```html\n\u003c!doctype HTML\u003e\n\u003chtml lang=\"en\"\u003e\n    \u003chead\u003e\n        \u003ctitle\u003eThis is the page title.\u003c/title\u003e\n    \u003c/head\u003e\n\u003cbody\u003e\n    \u003ch1\u003eHere's an example large heading.\u003c/h1\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003eThis is an example paragraph of text.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/body\u003e\n\u003c/html\u003e\n```\n\nIn other words...\n- All HTML documents must start with a document type declaration: `\u003c!doctype HTML\u003e`.\n- The HTML document itself begins with `\u003chtml\u003e` and ends with `\u003c/html\u003e`.\n- The `\u003chead\u003e` of the HTML document contains the metadata about the document, such as the `\u003ctitle\u003e`.\n- The visible part of the HTML document is between `\u003cbody\u003e` and `\u003c/body\u003e`, which can hold any number of elements you want to display.\n\n### Useful Tags\n\nThere are many tags you will find yourself using in HTML. Here are some of the most common:\n\n- `\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e`: This tag defines a paragraph of text.\n- `\u003ch1\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e`: This tag defines a header, or a large series of text.\n- `\u003ch2\u003c/h2\u003e`: This tag defines a smaller header, or a smaller series of text. It descends all the way down to `\u003ch6\u003e`.\n- `\u003cimg src =\"...\" alt=\"Text for accessibility purposes\" /\u003e`: This tag sets an image to display, with an alternative text for accessibility. Note that it is a void element, meaning it doesn't have a closing tag.\n- `\u003ca href=\"...\"\u003e...\u003c/a\u003e`: This tag creates a hyperlink.\n- `\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e`:  This tag designates a container block or section for other elements.\n- `\u003csection\u003e\u003c/section\u003e`: This tag creates a section of content.\n\nThere are many, many other tags you will encounter in the wild. You can find a complete list of tags here: [HTML Tags](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/default.asp).\n\nIn your browser, you can observe the HTML for any page you encounter using the same browser's developer tools you used to open the console. It may not make much sense depending on the page you are looking at, but it can often be a good way to to simply get a glimpse of what the HTML looks like. Open the `index.html` page in your browser and right-click on the page and select `View Source`. You should be familiar with the code you are seeing.\n\n### HTML Attributes\n\nIn the `\u003chtml\u003e` tag in our `index.html` file, you'll also notice we have added `lang=\"en\"`. This is called an _attribute_. Attributes are pieces of information that are added to a tag element, and follow the syntax `attribute=\"value\"`. They allow us to modify the behavior of the element in a variety of ways or to add information. Here we wrote `lang=\"en\"` to define the language of the document as English (a common practice as info for the browser). \n\nYou'll also notice, in the `\u003cscript\u003e` tag, that we added a `src` attribute. We'll discuss this in more detail later in this lesson. Throughout the course, you'll be introduced to a variety of useful attributes that you can use to modify elements in your HTML pages. For now, however, just keep in mind the syntax so you can recognize attributes when you see them.\n\nNow that we have some basic understanding of how an HTML document is set up, let's move on to CSS to add some style to our webpage.\n\n## CSS\n\nAs mentioned earlier, HTML works in conjunction with CSS to define the style of a webpage. \n\nExamples of what CSS can help you modify include:\n- What background color you want to use for the page or a paragraph.\n- What font or font size you want for your headings or your normal text.\n- How large you want the images, and whether you want them aligned center, left, or right.\n- Where elements appear on the page.\n- Whether elements are visible to a user or not.\n\nAnd much more! \n\n### Adding A New Stylesheet\n\nCSS files are called _stylesheets_. Let's create a new file called `style.css` in our project so we can modify the style of our HTML page. The useful thing about stylesheets is that we simply need to create _one_, which will then control the layout of many different HTML documents.\n\nTo add a new file in VSCode, simply click on the \"New File\" button next to your project title in the Explorer window. Type `styles.css` into the name field and hit \u003ckbd\u003eEnter\u003c/kbd\u003e. Make sure to add the `.css` extension to the name.\n\nNext, we'll link to the `style.css` file in our HTML file so it can be applied to our webpage. In our HTML file, we'll connect the files through a void `\u003clink\u003e` tag that lives inside the _parent_, or containing, `\u003chead\u003e` tag. Its `href` attribute is a link to our CSS document. The link tag is as follows:\n\n```html\n\u003clink rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"styles.css\"\u003e\n```\n\nThe `rel` attribute is used to define the relationship between the HTML document and the CSS document. In this case, the relationship is `stylesheet` because we are linking a CSS stylesheet. The `href` attribute is used to define the location of the CSS document. In this case, the location is relative to the location of the HTML document (it lives in the same folder), so we'll just provide the name of the CSS file.\n\nSo, open the `index.html` file in VSCode and add the `\u003clink\u003e` to the `\u003chead\u003e` section like so:\n\n```html\n\u003c!doctype HTML\u003e\n\u003chtml lang=\"en\"\u003e\n  \u003chead\u003e\n    \u003cmeta charset=\"utf-8\"\u003e\n    \u003clink rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"styles.css\"\u003e\n    \u003ctitle\u003eMy JavaScripting Master's Student Project\u003c/title\u003e\n  \u003c/head\u003e\n  \u003cbody\u003e\n    \u003ch1\u003eThis is my project!\u003c/h1\u003e\n    \u003cscript src=\"script.js\"\u003e\u003c/script\u003e\n  \u003c/body\u003e\n\u003c/html\u003e\n```\n\n### Styling Elements\n\nNext, let's start adding some styling to our page. In the `styles.css` file, let's add a background color. We'll do this by adding a `background-color` property to the `body` element. \n\n```css\nbody {\n    background-color: rgb(118, 92, 120);\n  }\n``` \n\nTo modify an HTML element, you first indicate which element you want to modify, followed by curly braces containing the properties you want to modify. In this case, we want to modify the `background-color` of the `body` element. Lines within the curly braces are called _declarations_, and they change the formatting of the elements in the HTML document. Each line in the declaration sets the value for a property and ends with a semicolon `;`.\n\nTo define the color, we use the `rgb()` function. This function takes three numbers as arguments that represent color values, and returns a color in the form `rgb(Red, Green, Blue)`. In this case, I'm using the RGB values for a purplish grey color, but you can use whatever color you'd like. VSCode usually comes equipped with a built-in color picker, so you can just click on the color you want and it will appear in the text field. If you can't see the color picker, you can also determine particular RGB values using [this online resource](https://htmlcolorcodes.com/color-picker/) to get the RGB value you want along with analogous colors. \n\n__Note:__ High contrast is very important for people with visual disabilities. So, when designing websites always ensure that the contrast between the text color and the background color (or background image) is good! See [this very useful contrast checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/).\n\nIf you save the CSS file and open the HTML file in your browser, you should now see the background color change.\n\nNext, let's modify the header element a bit. Let's make it white, a different font, and a little bigger. We'll also set it to be bold and center it.\n\n```css\nh1 {\n    color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\n    font-size: 50px;\n    font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif;\n    font-weight: bold;\n    text-align: center;\n  }\n```\n\nAs you can see, each of these aspects have their own properties you can modify. If you add this code to your file and refresh your browser, you should see the header centered and modified accordingly.\n\nNext, let's add a paragraph with some text to our page. We'll start by adding a `\u003cp\u003e` tag to our HTML file, within the `\u003cbody\u003e`. I'm going to add a very bad (sorry!) joke to my site, but you can write whatever you'd like.\n\n```html\n\u003c!doctype HTML\u003e\n\u003chtml lang=\"en\"\u003e\n  \u003chead\u003e\n    \u003cmeta charset=\"utf-8\"\u003e\n    \u003clink rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"styles.css\"\u003e\n    \u003ctitle\u003eMy JavaScripting Master's Student Project\u003c/title\u003e\n  \u003c/head\u003e\n  \u003cbody\u003e\n    \u003ch1\u003eThis is my project!\u003c/h1\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003eQ: Why did the programmer quit her job?\n      A: Because she didn't get arrays.\u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003cscript src=\"script.js\"\u003e\u003c/script\u003e\n  \u003c/body\u003e\n\u003c/html\u003e\n```\n\nNext, let's add some styling to the paragraph. We'll follow the same process as we did for the header, but we'll make the text size a bit smaller (20px smaller, to be precise).\n\n```css\np {\n    color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\n    font-size: 30px;\n    text-align: center;\n    font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif;\n    white-space: pre-line;\n  }\n```\n\nThe other addition is the `white-space` property. This property allows you to control how whitespace is handled. In this case, I wanted to preserve the line break in the text so the question and answer are on different lines, so I set the value to `pre-line`.\n\nIf you save and reload, you should see something like the following:\n\n![First CSS styling](/images/1_css-styling.png)\n\n### CSS Selectors\n\nCSS is made up of selectors with specific properties. Selectors are usually tags, ids, or classes. Let's take a look at both of the latter selectors. `id` will allow us to select a single element by its id and modify it. `class` will allow us to efficiently modify a number of elements with the same class at once.\n\n#### Class\n\nIn our project page so far, we applied many of the same styles to the `\u003ch1\u003e` element as well as to the `\u003cp\u003e` element. For instance, we centered them both, made them both white, changed the font, etc. This works, but is ultimately repetitive and inefficient because we had to rewrite the same code. Using the `\u003cdiv\u003e` tag and classes, we can make this much easier.\n\nFirst, let's create a class in our CSS file. We'll create a class called `formatText` and use it to style all the text on the page.\n\n```css\n.formatText {\n    color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\n    text-align: center;\n    font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif;\n    white-space: pre-line;\n  }\n```\n\nTo create a class, we use the `.` (dot) character followed by the name of the class. We can then use the class in our HTML file. Let's use the `\u003cdiv\u003e` tag, which acts like a container for other elements, and style it with our class. Everything within the `\u003cdiv\u003e` tag will then be styled according to the `.formatText` properties.\n\n\n```html\n\u003c!doctype HTML\u003e\n\u003chtml lang=\"en\"\u003e\n  \u003chead\u003e\n    \u003cmeta charset=\"utf-8\"\u003e\n    \u003clink rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"styles.css\"\u003e\n    \u003ctitle\u003eMy JavaScripting Master's Student Project\u003c/title\u003e\n  \u003c/head\u003e\n  \u003cbody\u003e\n    \u003cdiv class=\"formatText\"\u003e\n      \u003ch1\u003eThis is my project!\u003c/h1\u003e\n      \u003cp\u003eQ: Why did the programmer quit her job?\n        A: Because she didn't get arrays.\u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003c/div\u003e\n    \u003cscript src=\"script.js\"\u003e\u003c/script\u003e\n  \u003c/body\u003e\n\u003c/html\u003e\n```\n\nAs you can see, we use the `class` selector to style the `\u003cdiv\u003e` element with the name of the class we created. We include both text elements within the bounds of the `\u003cdiv\u003e` tag so they are both styled the same.\n\nBack in our CSS file, we can now delete the repetitive bits. Our `\u003ch1\u003e` element now only needs to be distinguished by font size and boldness...\n\n```css\nh1 {\n    font-size: 50px;\n    font-weight: bold;\n  }\n```\n\n...while our `\u003cp\u003e` element only needs to be distinguished by the text size.\n\n```css\np {\n    font-size: 30px;\n  }\n```\n\nAll together, your CSS file should now look something like this:\n\n```css\nbody {\n    background-color: rgb(118, 92, 120);\n  }\n\nh1 {\n    font-size: 50px;\n    font-weight: bold;\n  }\n\np {\n    font-size: 30px;\n  }\n\n.formatText {\n    color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\n    text-align: center;\n    font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif;\n    white-space: pre-line;\n  }\n```\n\nSave and reload the page, and you should see the same result as before. What, then, was the point? Well, by using classes we have reduced the amount of code we need to write and made it much more readable and organized. Classes are very useful when you know you want to style many elements at once with a number of common or generic properties. You can apply classes to almost any element, and every element can even have multiple classes! Just separate the names with a space, like so:\n\n```html\n\u003cdiv class=\"firstClass secondClass thirdClass\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n```\n\nThis is a particularly powerful feature of classes.\n\n##### ID\n\nIn contrast to classes, IDs are unique. They are used to identify a _single_ element in the HTML file rather than many. This is useful when you want to style a single element, but you don't want to style every element with the same properties.\n\nLet's say we wanted to set our joke apart from the header text a bit. Let's add a border around the joke text and provide it with a different background and font color. Let's also add a second joke to the page.\n\nThere are several ways we could do this, but the best might be to use a _flexbox_. Flexbox is a method to lay out elements in a way that is more efficient than using absolute positioning (or manually figuring out height, width, and dimensions of the page). It is a way to allow for a dynamic positioning of elements on a particular page. This layout also makes elements responsive, which means that the elements change their behavior according to the kind of device displaying them. No matter if you are viewing the page on a mobile phone or a computer monitor, the elements will be provided with appropriate position and symmetry. In general, flexbox is one of the best methods for vertically and horizontally centering elements because it’s responsive and doesn’t require margin calculations.\n\nLet's start by creating a new section in our HTML file, and adding a new `id` of `joke` to designate it as the joke section. I'll also add a new bad joke, this time at the expense of academics:\n\n```html\n\u003c!doctype HTML\u003e\n\u003chtml lang=\"en\"\u003e\n  \u003chead\u003e\n    \u003cmeta charset=\"utf-8\"\u003e\n    \u003clink rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"styles.css\"\u003e\n    \u003ctitle\u003eMy JavaScripting Master's Student Project\u003c/title\u003e\n  \u003c/head\u003e\n  \u003cbody\u003e\n    \u003cdiv class=\"formatText\"\u003e\n      \u003ch1\u003eThis is my project!\u003c/h1\u003e\n        \u003csection id=\"joke\"\u003e     \n          \u003cp\u003eQ: Why did the programmer quit her job?\n          A: Because she didn't get arrays.\u003c/p\u003e\n          \u003cp\u003eQ: What's the difference between an academic and a genie?\n          A: One grants wishes, the other wishes for grants.\u003c/p\u003e\n        \u003c/section\u003e\n    \u003c/div\u003e\n    \u003cscript src=\"script.js\"\u003e\u003c/script\u003e\n  \u003c/body\u003e\n\u003c/html\u003e\n```\n\nYou can see that we have now designated a new `\u003csection\u003e` with an `id` of `joke`. Next, let's move to our CSS file to define the properties for the section.\n\nThe syntax for ids is mostly the same as classes, but instead of using the `.` (dot) character, we use the `#` (hash) character:\n\n```css\n#joke {\n    border: 5px solid rgb(16, 29, 55);\n    background-color: rgb(118, 125, 158);\n    display: flex;\n    flex-direction: column;\n    justify-content: center;\n    align-items: center;\n    width: 50%;\n    margin: 0 auto;\n    color: rgb(255, 230, 204);\n  }\n```\n\nWe have several new things here, so let's break them down. First, we create a border around the joke text. We use the `border` property to set the border width (`5px` = 5 pixels) and style. `solid` indicates a solid fill border, and we set the color to a dark blue. We also use the `display` property to set the display type of our `joke` id to `flex`. This is defining our flexbox layout. We use the `flex-direction` property to set the direction of the layout to `column`. Flexboxes can utilize horizontal rows (this is defining their \"direction\") as well as a columnar structure. Choosing columns allows us to place jokes one below the other on our page and make it easier to read. In other words, each `\u003cp\u003e` element within the joke `\u003csection\u003e` will appear evenly spaced below the first as a long column of jokes.\n\n We then use the `justify-content` and `align-items` properties to set the alignment of the elements to `center`. This means that the elements (the jokes) will be aligned in the center of the flex container. We use the `width` property to set the width of the overall flex container to 50% of the width of the screen, and we use the `margin` property to set the margin to `0 auto`. This means that the container will be centered on the screen (the margins will be even on each side and it will warp to 50% of the screen width). Finally, we use the `color` property to set the text color to a light peach color.\n\n If you save and reload the page, you should now see something like the following:\n\n![joke id](/images/2_css-styling.png)\n\nNice! You'll notice that even though the id is located within the `.formatText` class (i.e., the parent class) and that its styling is still being applied, you can nest ids and classes within each other to override the particular styling of the parent or container they are in. This allows you to create a complex hierarchy of styles that can be applied to many elements at once.\n\nBy creating a joke id we now have a specific section to hold and style all our terrible jokes. At this point I might encourage you to check out the [flexbox guide here](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) to learn a bit more about flexboxes, as they are incredibly useful for modern CSS.\n\nAdditionally, while there are far, far too many CSS properties to cover in this course, I also urge you to at least peek through the [entire CSS reference library](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference) and bookmark it. Try looking up the `flex` property, or any of the other properties we have used so far.\n\n### External, Internal, and Inline CSS\n\nAs a final note about CSS, in this course we are using an _external_ CSS file, meaning it is its own separate file that we have to link to in our HTML. This is the recommended way to utilize CSS. However, it is possible to use CSS directly in your HTML file as well, through both _internal_ and _inline_ methods. If you are curious, you can visit [this page to understand the differences](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_howto.asp) between these methods. In general, however, just keep in mind that using external CSS files is the preferred method of using CSS.\n\n## JavaScript\n\nSo far, we have just been using HTML and CSS to style our page. The only bit of JavaScript we have is linked through the `\u003cscript\u003e` tag, located in the `\u003cbody\u003e` of the HTML file:\n\n```html\n    \u003cscript src=\"script.js\"\u003e\u003c/script\u003e\n```\n\nThe `src` (source) attribute is used to link to the JavaScript file `script.js`. This is the file that contains the code that will be executed when the page loads. At the moment, the only thing it is doing is alerting the user that your project is going to be awesome.\n\nIn the next lesson, we will learn how to use JavaScript to create a more complex webpage with some actual interactivity. For now, let's just review some of the concepts we've learned soWEll far concerning HTML and CSS.\n\n## Review Questions\n\n1. How do we associate a CSS stylesheet with a HTML file? (select one)\n\n\u003cQuiz\u003e\n- By including a link to the CSS file in the HTML page's `\u003chead\u003e` element.*\n- By including the CSS file in the HTML page's `\u003cbody\u003e` element.\n- By sheer coincidence.\n\u003c/Quiz\u003e\n\n2.

To learn about this tag, [see this page](https://www.w3schools.com/Html/html_links.asp).\n\n3. Create a new `\u003csection\u003e` in your HTML file to display your favorite poem. In CSS, give it an appropriate id, and define the section as a centered flexbox with a different border, background color, and text color.\n\n4. Push all your changes to the project to GitHub.\n\n## Key Terms\n\nDo you remember the meaning of the following terms?\n\n- self-closing or void tags\n- metadata\n- attributes\n- class\n- id\n- flexbox\n\n# Interactive Web Design\n\nNow that you have a basic understanding of HTML and CSS, let's begin using JavaScript to add more interactivity to your webpage. \n\nJust as a note, for the rest of this course, we will be switching back and forth between environments (e.g., VSCode, the browser, the console) as well as between languages (e.g., JavaScript, HTML, and CSS) fairly often. This might be a little confusing and disorienting at first, but with a bit of practice it will eventually begin to feel more natural. \n\nBefore we get to working with JavaScript, there are a few things we'll want to do. The first is to get a local server up and running so we can test our code on the fly, and the next will be to incorporate the jQuery library into our code. Let's accomplish these now.\n\n## Running a Live Server in VSCode\n\nSo far, we have simply double-clicked the `index.html` file in your computer's file system and opened it in the browser. This is a perfectly fine way to get started previewing our webpage, but it may cause issues as we add more complexity. To address this, let's add an extension to our VSCode that will allow us to run a local web server to load and preview our webpage.\n\nOpen up your project in VSCode. Next, click on the Extensions button in the sidebar.\n\n![vscode extension](/images/open_extensions.png)\n\nIn the search field, type `live server` and press enter.\n\nOpen the Live Server extension (it will likely be the first search result, see below for specifics), and click Install.\n\n![Live Server](/images/live_server.png)\n\nOnce installed, you should see a new button in the taskbar on the bottom-right of VSCode that says \"Go Live\".\n\n![Go Live](/images/go_live.png)\n\nClicking this button will open a new window that will load your webpage in the browser. Now, you can make changes to your page and, after saving the file in VScode, you can see your changes immediately reflected in the browser. Try changing some of the text on your page, saving it, and returning to your page in the browser. You should see your changes display, without even needing to reload the page. \n\nPretty neat, right?\n\nTo shut down the server, simply click on the button (now showing the port #) in the taskbar again.\n\n## Importing jQuery\n\nNext, we will incorporate the __jQuery library__ into our code. JQuery is an open-source JavaScript library that allows us to build our webpage without needing to reinvent the wheel in terms of common functionality. It takes many of the typical tasks that would usually take many lines of JavaScript or HTML code to accomplish, and simplifies them into functions that you can call with a single line of code. In short, it is a \"library\" in the sense that it provides us with many pre-written functions that we can use to make our webpage writing much more simple and efficient.\n\nFirst, we need to import the jQuery library into our code. To do this, we need to add another script tag to our HTML file. Above the `script.js` import in the `\u003cbody\u003e`, add the following line:\n\n```html\n\u003cscript src=\"https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.6.0.min.js\"\u003e\u003c/script\u003e\n```\n\nHere we are importing the jQuery library from the [jQuery CDN](https://code.jquery.com/) (Content Delivery Network). In other words, our `src` attribute is directed to the web server `code.jquery.com` and is told to download the source file `jquery-3.6.0.min.js`, which is the latest version of jQuery (at the time of writing this).\n\nNext, let's learn how to use jQuery to perform some basic tasks.\n\n## Using jQuery\n\n### Selecting Elements\n\nThe first function we will cover is the __jQuery selector__, which is one of the most important functions in jQuery. It allows us to select and manipulate HTML elements on our page. It is used to \"find\" HTML elements based on their name, id, class, type, and other attributes.\n\nAll selectors start with a dollar sign followed by parentheses: `$(\"\")`. A selector takes a single argument in the parentheses (set between doublequotes `\"\"`), which is the element we want to modify. Let's look at some basic examples.\n\n### Selecting the Header\n\nCurrently, our header in the `\u003ch1\u003e` tag seems a bit unnecessary. All it is doing is telling us `This is my project!`, which is information we clearly already know (and which also doesn't do much for the visitor to the site). We could, of course, simply change the text to something more appropriate, but to show you the power of jQuery selectors, let's play around with this element a bit and see how we can use JavaScript to modify it.\n\nFirst, we could simply hide the header from our page so that visitors to the site would not see it. In your `script.js`, add the following line:\n\n```JavaScript\n$(\"h1\").hide();\n```\n\nWe begin by selecting `$` the `h1` element of our page, and then we use the `.hide()` method to hide the element. This will remove the header from view on our page, but keep it in our HTML code. Save the file and check out your page in the browser. The header with the message `This is my project!` should now be hidden from view.\n\nWhat happens now if we add a new header to replace the old one? Let's try it out. In your `index.html`, add a new header below the old one:\n\n```html\n\u003ch1\u003eThis is my project!\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003ch1\u003eBad Jokes Galore!\u003c/h1\u003e\n```\n\nSave the file and check out your page in the browser. What happens?\n\nNothing, right? The new header is not visible to the visitor either. This is because by using the `$(\"h1\")` selector to hide, we are selecting _all_ the `h1` elements in our page. In other words, any `\u003ch1\u003e` tag we try to add will be hidden from view.\n\n### Selecting by ID\n\nLet's address this by utilizing an __ID selector__ instead. This will allow us to select a single element. In your `index.html`, let's define an id `noShow` for the header we specifically want to hide, like so:\n\n```html\n\u003ch1 id=\"noShow\"\u003eThis is my project!\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003ch1\u003eBad Jokes Galore!\u003c/h1\u003e\n```\nNext, let's change our selector so that only the element with the id `noShow` is hidden instead of all `h1` elements. In your `script.js`, change the original hide code to the following:\n\n```JavaScript\n$(\"#noShow\").hide();\n```\n\nTo select by id, we use the `#` (hash) symbol followed by the id name (this is, as you might recall, the same when styling by id in CSS). If you save and view the page, you should now see the old header hidden from view, but the new header still visible:\n\n![id selector](/images/id_selector.png)\n\nGreat!\n\n...well, perhaps we think these jokes are getting too much flak. In fact, let's consider that these may actually be the best jokes ever. Why don't we change the text of the header to reflect this more positive attitude (no matter how misguided it may be)? We could, of course, simply change the text manually in the HTML file, but we can also use the `.html()` method to change the text of an element entirely in JavaScript.\n\nIn your `script.js`, add the following line:\n\n```JavaScript\n$(\"h1\").html(\"The Best Jokes Ever!\");\n```\n\nIf you save and check your page, you should now see the header text changed to `The Best Jokes Ever!`. \n\n![change header](/images/change_header_text.png)\n\nKeep in mind, again, that because we are specifying the `h1` tag, this will change the text of _all_ `h1` elements in the page to \"The Best Jokes Ever!\" If you were to add another header anywhere on the page, it would also change the text to \"The Best Jokes Ever!\". This is clunky and wouldn't be advised for more complex webpages, but will work for now just for demonstration purposes.\n\n### Selecting by Class\n\nSelecting by class is the same as selecting by id, but instead of using the `#` symbol, we use the `.` (dot) symbol. You can select any class element with the following syntax:\n\n```JavaScript\n$(\".className\")\n```\n\nThis will allow you to modify or manipulate all elements with the class `className` in the page, just as you did with the id selector.\n\n### Appending Elements\n\nLet's say we wanted to add a new joke to our page. We could simply add a new `\u003cp\u003e` tag to our HTML file like we did in earlier lessons, but we can also add elements with jQuery. It makes sense to use JavaScript here anyway--for instance, what if we wanted users to be able to post their own jokes to the page? We would want a way to automatically update the list of jokes rather than doing it manually ourselves in HTML. \n\nSo, let's use the `.append()` method to add a new joke to our `joke` section. In your `script.js`, add the following line:\n\n```JavaScript\n$(\"#joke\").append(\"\u003cp\u003eQ. What do you call a fake noodle? \u003cbr /\u003e A. An impasta\u003c/p\u003e\");\n```\n\nHere we are identifying the element with the id `joke` (used for our joke `\u003csection\u003e`) and adding a new paragraph `\u003cp\u003e` element to it. To keep a line break between the question and answer, we use the self-closing HTML `\u003cbr /\u003e` (break) tag in between. Save the file and check out your page in the browser.\n\n![append joke](/images/append_joke.png)\n\nCool, we now have three ~~terrible~~ amazing jokes on our page.\n\nTo wrap up, keep in mind that...\n- `$(\"\")` is the jQuery selector.\n- To select an element by id, use `#` followed by the id name.\n- To select an element by class, use `.` followed by the class name.\n- You can use methods like `.hide()` and `.html()` and `.append()` to modify elements that you select. \n\n## Adding Interactivity\n\nOkay, we have learned how to use jQuery to select and manipulate elements on our page. However, we still don't have any real interactivity. As a basic example, let's add a button that will allow us to show and hide the jokes section from view on the page.\n\n### Creating a Button\n\nTo create the button, add the following code to your `index.html` file, underneath your header tags:\n\n```html\n\u003cbutton id=\"toggleJokes\"\u003eToggle Jokes\u003c/button\u003e\n```\n\nHere we have a simple `\u003cbutton\u003e` element set to an id `toggleJokes`. If you save your file, you should now see a basic button on the page above your jokes section.\n\nYou can see that it doesn't look very good at the moment, so why don't we add a bit of styling to make it better? Now, we could simply style the button in our CSS file like we did with other elements in the page. For example, to make the button orange, with larger white text, a border, some padding, and some margin space around the button to separate it from other elements, we could add the following code to our `style.css` file:\n\n```css\n#toggleJokes {\n    background-color: orange;\n    color: white;\n    font-size: 20px;\n    border: 1px solid white;\n    border-radius: 5px;\n    padding: 10px;\n    margin: 10px;\n}\n```\n\nHere we are styling the button with the id `toggleJokes` using the CSS styling techniques we learned about earlier. This would probably be the best and most efficient way to style the button. However, you can also style an element entirely in JavaScript. Why don't we try this instead?\n\n### CSS Styling in JavaScript\n\nWe can use the `.css()` method to add styling to any element. For example, take a look at the code below:\n\n```JavaScript\n// modify css styles for the button\n$(\"#toggleJokes\").css(\"background-color\", \"orange\");\n$(\"#toggleJokes\").css(\"color\", \"white\");\n$(\"#toggleJokes\").css(\"font-size\", \"20px\");\n$(\"#toggleJokes\").css(\"padding\", \"10px\");\n$(\"#toggleJokes\").css(\"border-radius\", \"5px\");\n$(\"#toggleJokes\").css(\"border\", \"2px solid black\");\n$(\"#toggleJokes\").css(\"margin\", \"10px\");\n```\n\nHere, we are modifying the the many CSS properties of the button with the id `toggleJokes`. When using the `.css()` method, you must specify the property name and the value you want to set it to. As you can see, we use the same properties and values as we do when writing regular CSS styles. JavaScript, HTML, and CSS are very interwoven languages.\n\nInstead of writing a bunch of separate lines, we can also use the `.css()` method to modify the styles of multiple properties of an element at once. To do so, you simply wrap the properties in curly braces and separate them with a comma, writing them out as you would in a typical CSS style sheet:\n\n```JavaScript\n// modify css styles for the button\n$(\"#toggleJokes\").css({\n    \"background-color\": \"orange\",\n    \"color\": \"white\",\n    \"font-size\": \"20px\",\n    \"padding\": \"10px\",\n    \"border-radius\": \"5px\",\n    \"border\": \"2px solid black\",\n    \"margin\": \"10px\"\n});\n```\n\nThis is functionally the same, but is cleaner and easier to read. Add this code to your `script.js` file and save your file. You should see something like the following:\n\n![Button Styling](/images/style_button.png)\n\nA bit ugly still, but at least it has some flavor. Again, while it is preferred to define your styles _within your CSS stylesheet_, you can see how JavaScript can add dynamic styles to your elements as well. Each language forms a part of the whole to define the user's experience.\n\nSpeaking of user experience, if you try clicking on the button, you'll notice it doesn't do anything yet. Let's add some proper interactivity to it.\n\n### Making the Button Clickable\n\nWe'll want this button to both show and hide the jokes section. Now, we could write a somewhat complex function that would `hide()` the jokes section when the button is clicked (and when the text is displayed), while also `show()` the jokes section when the button is clicked (when the text is hidden), but here's an example of jQuery to the rescue, simplifying things for us. You can simply use the `.toggle()` method to toggle the display (visible/invisible) of a particular element.\n\nTo accomplish this, however, we need to make the button clickable in the first place. We can do this by using another jQuery method, `.click()`, which will add a click __event__ to the button. You can think of events as \"things that happen\" to your HTML elements (text fields being typed in, buttons being clicked, etc). So, in your `script.js`, add the following lines:\n\n```JavaScript\n$(\"#toggleJokes\").click(function() {\n  $(\"#joke\").toggle();\n});\n```\n\nFirst we select the button with the id `toggleJokes` and then add a click event to it. We attach a simple function to the `click()` event so it will run when the click occurs. This function selects the `joke` section and adds a `.toggle()` method to it.\n\nIf you save and check your page, you should now be able to click on the button and see the jokes section disappear and reappear. \n\nVery well done! You're already a successful web developer.\n\n## Additional jQuery Methods\n\nThere are many, many more jQuery methods available (way too many to cover). You can find a full list of them [here](http://api.jquery.com/).\n\nAs their slogan has it, with jQuery the intent is to \"write less, do more\". It allows you to very easily perform tasks and manage behaviors on your page without having to write lengthy, complicated code for common situations. As your web project grows more interactive, the potential for using more jQuery grows along with it.\n\n## Review Questions\n\n1.

In this lesson, we'll build a digital version of a famous poem that will allow users to click on aspects of the poem to see more information about the literary devices being used. It is meant to be an educational tool for anyone who is interested in the techniques utilized in the poem.\n\nAs a preliminary note, this lesson might take you a bit longer to get through. We will be learning about a variety of important new concepts, so take your time and try to understand each step before moving on. \n\nAre you ready? \n\nLet's get into it!\n\n## The Poem\n\nBecause we are all in NYC and have likely experienced the throbbing, perpetual daylight of Times Square, as a dataset let's work with Walt Whitman's famous poem _Broadway_, published in 1888. Here is the poem in its entirety:\n\n    Broadway\n    Walt Whitman\n\n    What hurrying human tides, or day or night!\n    What passions, winnings, losses, ardors, swim thy waters!\n    What whirls of evil, bliss and sorrow, stem thee!\n    What curious questioning glances- glints of love!\n    Leer, envy, scorn, contempt, hope, aspiration!\n    Thou portal- thou arena- thou of the myriad long-drawn lines and groups!\n    (Could but thy flagstones, curbs, facades, tell their inimitable tales;\n    Thy windows rich, and huge hotels- thy side-walks wide;)\n    Thou of the endless sliding, mincing, shuffling feet!\n    Thou, like the parti-colored world itself- like infinite, teeming,\n    mocking life!\n    Thou visor'd, vast, unspeakable show and lesson!\n\nOur goal will be to create a page that prints these lines and turns certain parts into clickable elements. When the user does click, the page will display a message below the text that contains information about that element.\n\n## Setting Up the Page\n\nLet's create a new page specifically for our poem. Perhaps the simplest way for now will be to just create a link to our page in the `index.html` file. So, within the `\u003cdiv\u003e` container on your page, add the following code for a link:\n\n```HTML\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003ca href=\"poem.html\"\u003eWalt Whitman's \u003cem\u003eBroadway\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n```\n\nThe `\u003cem\u003e\u003c/em\u003e` tags stand for emphasis, which allows us to italicize words.\n\nNext, create a new file (by clicking the New File button in the VSCode Explorer Window) called `poem.html`. Paste into it this basic structure:\n\n```html\n\u003c!doctype html\u003e\n\u003chtml lang=\"en\"\u003e\n  \u003chead\u003e\n    \u003cmeta charset=\"utf-8\"\u003e\n    \u003ctitle\u003eWalt Whitman's Broadway\u003c/title\u003e\n    \u003clink rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"poem.css\"\u003e\n  \u003c/head\u003e\n  \u003cbody\u003e\n    \u003cdiv class=\"container\"\u003e\n      \u003ch1\u003e\u003cem\u003eBroadway\u003c/em\u003e by Walt Whitman\u003c/h1\u003e\n      \u003cdiv id=\"intro\"\u003e\n        \u003cp\u003eWelcome to the page for Walt Whitman's poem \u003cem\u003eBroadway\u003c/em\u003e. Click on elements to see more information about them.\u003c/p\u003e\n      \u003c/div\u003e\n      \u003cdiv id=\"poem\"\u003e\n      \u003c/div\u003e\n      \u003cdiv id=\"info\"\u003e\n      \u003c/div\u003e\n    \u003cscript src=\"https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.6.0.min.js\"\u003e\u003c/script\u003e\n    \u003cscript src=\"poem.js\"\u003e\u003c/script\u003e\n  \u003c/body\u003e\n\u003c/html\u003e\n```\n\nYou'll see that we are adding a new dedicated stylesheet to work with `poem.css`, as well as a new script file to work with `poem.js`. Let's go ahead and create those now (again click New File \u003e `poem.css` and `poem.js`).\n\nUse the \"Go Live\" button to see your new page and make sure you are seeing the intro text display. \n\nNow that we have a page, let's convert our poem into usable JavaScript data.\n\n## Converting the Poem into Data\n\nWe have seen how both `arrays` and `objects` allow us to store large quantities of data. Here we have 11 lines of a poem, with a variable amount of words per line. We want to be able to manipulate each word as well as each line, if needed.\n\nWe could envision an array of `lines`, that stores another array of `words`. But, just like we did with our Student Grades program in a previous lesson, it would probably be best to create an `array` containing a series of `objects`. \n\nLet's take a look at what this might mean for the first line of the poem. \n\n```JavaScript\nlet line1 = [{text:  \"What\"}, {text: \"hurrying\"}, {text: \"human\"}, {text: \"tides\"}, {text: \"or\"}, {text: \"day\"}, {text: \"or\"}, {text: \"night!\"}];\n```\n\nHere we have the first line of the poem, broken up into words. Each word is an `object` with a `text` property that designates each word of the poem.\n\n### The `map()` Method\n\nTo perform an operation on each of these elements, we can use a new JavaScript method called `map()`. This method allows us to iterate over each element of an array and perform an operation (specifically, a function) on each element.\n\nThis method takes the function as an argument and runs that function's operations as it iterates. In doing so, it will create a new array that you can use to store the results of the function without altering the original array.  In short, you use `.map()` whenever you want to build an array out of another array. In this case, we want to create a new array that contains the text of each word in the poem.\n\n```JavaScript\nlet line1TextArray = []\nline1TextArray = line1.map(function(word) {\n  return word.text;\n}); \n```\n\n`.map()` here creates a new array out of the array of word objects, and this new array contains just the `.text` property (the words) of each object. \n\nNow, we can put the phrase back together using another new method.\n\n### The `join()` Method\n\nThe `join()` method returns an array as a string. In other words, when applied to our array of words, it will return them together as a string, with spaces in between each word.\n\n```JavaScript\nlet line1Text = line1TextArray.join(\" \");\n```\n\nLet's put it all together in our `poem.js` file to see what it looks like.\n\n```JavaScript\n$(\"#info\").html(\"\u003cp\u003eThe info will go here.\u003c/p\u003e\");\nlet line1, line1Text; // don’t need the intermediate step of line1TextArray\nline1 = [{text:  \"What\"}, {text: \"hurrying\"}, {text: \"human\"}, {text: \"tides\"}, \n    {text: \"or\"}, {text: \"day\"}, {text: \"or\"}, {text: \"night!\"}];\nline1Text = line1.map(function(word){\n    return word.text;\n    }).join(\" \");\n$(\"#poem\").html(\"\u003cp\u003e\" + line1Text + \"\u003cbr /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\");\n```\n\nIf you save and check your page in the browser, you should see that we have successfully displayed the first line of the poem.\n\n![Poem first line](/images/poem_first_line.png)\n\n## Adding Information to the Poem\n\nNext, we'll want a way to display information about certain elements of the poem. To indicate which ones, we can add another property to specific word objects. Let's add a new property `info` that will provide information about the literary device being used.\n\n```JavaScript\n    line1 = [{text:  \"What\", info: \"Anaphora: The repetition of a word or phrase at the beginning of (usually successive) lines. For example, the use of What in the first four lines.\"}, \n        {text: \"hurrying\"}, {text: \"human\"}, {text: \"tides\"}, \n        {text: \"or\"}, {text: \"day\"}, {text: \"or\"}, {text: \"night!\"}];\n```\n\nHere you can see that we have added a new `info` property to the first word of the poem to describe the technique of [anaphora](https://literarydevices.net/anaphora/). \n\nThis way, we can send this info down to the `#info` div on the page when the user clicks the word. \n\n## Making Elements Clickable\n\nYou might recall our brief discussion of _events_ in the previous lesson. Events are the actions that occur when a user interacts with a certain element. For instance, when a user clicks on a button, a certain event occurs. \n\nWe want the user to be able to click on a word to find the appropriate information about it. Do you recall how we might accomplish this?\n\nWe can use the `click` event, of course! It will allow us to listen for a user's click on a certain element. To do this, however, we'll need to revamp our code a bit. We want to use word-size chunks of data here, so we'll need to get rid of our `.join()` method from before and instead iterate through the array word by word.\n\nFor now, just paste the following to overwrite all your current code:\n\n```JavaScript\n$(\"#info\").html(\"\u003cp\u003eThe info will go here.\u003c/p\u003e\");\nlet line1, line1Text; // don’t need the intermediate step of line1TextArray\nline1 = [{text:  \"What\", info: \"Anaphora: The repetition of a word or phrase at the beginning of (usually successive) lines. For example, the use of What in the first four lines.\"}, \n    {text: \"hurrying\"}, {text: \"human\"}, {text: \"tides\"}, \n    {text: \"or\"}, {text: \"day\"}, {text: \"or\"}, {text: \"night!\"}];\n// Create a blank string that opens two tags.\nline1Text = \"\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003e\"; // opening tags for blockquote and p, we close them in the loop below\nline1.map(function(word){\n  // Add in the word object’s .text property plus a space.\n  line1Text = line1Text + word.text + \" \";\n});\n// Break the line and close the two tags.\nline1Text = line1Text + \"\u003cbr /\u003e(line 2 would go here)\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\";\n$(\"#poem\").html(line1Text);\n```\n\nIf you save and check your page, you'll see functionally the same result as before. We use the `map()` method to iterate through the array of word objects, setting `line1Text` to the `.text` property of each word object and add spacing. We then use the `.html()` method to set the `#poem` `\u003cdiv\u003e` to the string we created. \n\nNext we'll want to check if a specific word has an `info` property. We can accomplish this by using an `if` statement within our `map()` method, like so:\n\n```JavaScript\nline1.map(function(word){\n  // Define a variable that will be the entirety of a single\n  // word-sized chunk of information.\n  let wordString;\n  wordString = word.text;\n  // Test to see if the .info property exists.\n  if (word.info){\n    // If it does, surround wordString in an \u003ca\u003e tag.\n    wordString = \"\u003ca href='#'\u003e\" + wordString + \"\u003c/a\u003e\";\n  }\n  // Add wordString plus a space to the line1Text.\n  line1Text = line1Text + wordString + \" \";\n});\n$(\"#poem\").html(line1Text);\n```\n\nFor each word in the array, we check to see if it has an `info` property using an `if` statement (if word.info == True). If it does, we add an `\u003ca\u003e` tag to the word, which will turn the word element into a clickable link. By capturing this in `wordString`, we can add it to the overall `line1Text` string phrase as usual. Otherwise, `wordString` will just be the word itself and get added as well.\n\nIf you save, you should be able to see the poem with \"What\" now clickable. If it you do click it, however, nothing will happen yet. Let's add in our `click` event listener:\n\n```JavaScript\n$(\"#poem a\").click(function(){\n    $(\"#info\").html(\"\u003ch2\u003eYou clicked on a word!\u003c/h2\u003e\");\n  });\n```\n\nIf you save and click on the word now, you should see \"This is where the info will go\" replaced by \"You clicked on a word!\". What's happening here is that we're listening for a click on every element in the page marked with an `\u003ca\u003e` tag (by using `#poem a`). Because we marked \"What\" with an `\u003ca\u003e`, the `.click` event knows to trigger. When that happens, we're setting the `#info` `\u003cdiv\u003e` to the text \"You clicked on a word!\".\n\nAll together, the code looks like this: \n\n```JavaScript\n$(\"#info\").html(\"\u003cp\u003eThe info will go here.\u003c/p\u003e\");\nlet line1, line1Text; // don’t need the intermediate step of line1TextArray\nline1 = [{text:  \"What\", info: \"Anaphora: The repetition of a word or phrase at the beginning of (usually successive) lines. For example, the use of What in the first four lines.\"}, \n    {text: \"hurrying\"}, {text: \"human\"}, {text: \"tides\"}, \n    {text: \"or\"}, {text: \"day\"}, {text: \"or\"}, {text: \"night!\"}];\n// Create a blank string that opens two tags.\nline1Text = \"\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003e\"; // opening tags for blockquote and p, we close them in the loop below\nline1.map(function(word){\n  // Define a variable that will be the entirety of a single\n  // word-sized chunk of information.\n  let wordString;\n  wordString = word.text;\n  // Test to see if the .info property exists.\n  if (word.info){\n    // If it does, surround wordString in an \u003ca\u003e tag.\n    wordString = \"\u003ca href='#'\u003e\" + wordString + \"\u003c/a\u003e\";\n  }\n  // Add wordString plus a space to the line1Text.\n  line1Text = line1Text + wordString + \" \";\n});\n$(\"#poem\").html(line1Text);\n$(\"#poem a\").click(function(){\n    // Define the text and the word that was clicked.\n    let infoText, clickedWord;\n    clickedWord = $( this ).text();\n    infoText = \"\u003ch2\u003eYou clicked on the word: \" + clickedWord + \"\u003c/h2\u003e\";\n    $(\"#info\").html(infoText);\n  });\n```\n\nOkay, we now have clickable elements that allow us to display info about words. However, we want to actually display the info in the `info` property we wrote out.\n\nThere are a few step we'll need to take to carry this out.\n\n## Accessing the Info Property\n\nWe have two things to accomplish here. First, we want to send specific information to the `#info` div. Second, we want that data to be the `info` property of the word that was clicked.\n\nLet's tackle the first part. We'll need to modify our `click` event listener:\n\n```JavaScript\n$(\"#poem a\").click(function(){\n    // Define the text and the word that was clicked.\n    let infoText, clickedWord;\n    clickedWord = $( this ).text();\n    infoText = \"\u003ch2\u003eYou clicked on the word: \" + clickedWord + \"\u003c/h2\u003e\";\n    $(\"#info\").html(infoText);\n  });\n```\n\nWe have a new element introduced here: the keyword `this`. In this context, `this` indicates a reference to the object that is currently being acted upon (e.g., whatever word that was just clicked). In short, we can use `this` to access the `.text` property of the word that was just clicked, whichever word that may be.\n\nWe haven't quite accomplished what we want here, but we're getting there. We can now access at least the `.text` property of the word that was clicked, but we still need to get at the `.info` property.\n\nTo do this, we'll need to use __data attributes__. Data attributes allow us to store data on an element and access it. They are custom-made attributes that we can apply on HTML elements.\n\nLet's make one, called `data-info`, and use it to modify the string of text we create in our `.map()` method:\n\n```JavaScript\nline1.map(function(word){\n  // Define a variable that will be the entirety of a single\n  // word-sized chunk of information.\n  let wordString;\n  wordString = word.text;\n  // Test to see if the .info property exists.\n  if (word.info){\n    // Add the data-info attribute to the word.\n    wordString = \"\u003ca href='#' data-info='\" + word.info + \"'\u003e\" + wordString + \"\u003c/a\u003e\";\n  }\n  // Add wordString plus a space to the line1Text.\n  line1Text = line1Text + wordString + \" \";\n});\n```\n\nHere we have added a new data attribute and utilized it to store the `.info` property of the word that was clicked. Be careful about copying this correctly: you'll notice that we need to close the opening `\u003ca` and `data-info` attribute with a `\u003e` closing tag, as well as correct opening and closing quotes to indicate the info is a string.\n\nIf you check the HTML element inspector in your browser, you should see that the info text is now stored in the `data-info` attribute.\n\nWe can now access this data attribute in our `click` event listener, using the `.data` method:\n\n```JavaScript\n$(\"#poem a\").click(function(){\n    let infoText, clickedWord, clickedInfo; //variables to capture the info text and the clicked text/info\n    clickedWord = $( this ).text(); // get the clicked word\n    // .data(\"info\") looks for the data-info HTML attribute.\n    clickedInfo = $( this ).data(\"info\"); // get the info from the clicked word using .data\n    infoText = clickedInfo; // set the info text var to the clicked info\n    $(\"#info\").html(infoText); // change the info div to the info text\n  });\n```\n\nIf you save and try to click on the word now, you should be rewarded with the info that was stored in the `.info` property about anaphora.\n\nOkay! So far so good. We've added in the ability to display info about words. However, all we currently have is one line of text. Surely we'd like to add _all_ the lines of the poem, right? Let's go about doing that now.\n\n## JSON\n\nTo use our dataset (our poem) more efficiently, we'll use JSON. JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation. We can use a JSON object (as a separate file) to store our poem data, and then use that data to populate our poem. \n\nJSON, as a data format, allows us to store data in a structured way and utilize it in a variety of ways in JavaScript. Like object syntax you have seen so far, JSON object data is written in key/value pairs. For instance, here's a object containing details about an example person named Charity Case in JSON:\n\n```JSON\n{\n   \"firstName\": \"Charity\",\n   \"lastName\": \"Case\",\n   \"age\": 30,\n   \"streetAddress\": \"404 Internet Dr\",\n   \"city\": \"JavaTown\",\n   \"state\": \"JA\",\n   \"postalCode\": \"12345\",\n   \"phoneNumbers\": [\n      { \"Mobile\": \"111-111-1111\" },\n      { \"Home\": \"222-222-2222\" }\n   ]\n}\n```\n\nAs you can see, we store data in key/value pairs as usual, and we can use both object and array syntax.\n\nUsing JSON, we can store our poem in a file called `poem.json`. As you might imagine, writing it all out is a bit of a pain, so luckily for you I've already done it. Download the `poem.json` file from the button below and save it to your working folder.\n\n\u003cDownload files='poem.json'\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\n\nIf you open the file in VSCode, you can see that we have stored the lines of the text in a similar fashion as we did before, with a `text` property for each word of the poem. I also went ahead and added a few extra literary devices for the first half of the poem and listed them as `info`. \n\nIn general, just keep in mind that:\n1. JSON objects are very much like JavaScript objects.\n2. JSON objects are written in key/value pairs.\n3. JSON objects are surrounded by curly braces `{ }`.\n4. Keys must be strings, and values must be a valid JSON data type (string, number, object, array, boolean or null).\n5. Keys and values are separated by a colon.\n6. Each key/value pair is separated by a comma.\n7. Arrays are enclosed in square brackets `[ ]` and each element is separated by a comma.\n\nNow that we have a full JSON file with our poem, let's use it to populate our page with the text. We'll need to revamp our code one more time to accomplish this. \n\nTo clearly observe the logic of what we have so far, let's take a look at the 3 different parts to our program:\n\n```JavaScript\n//Part 1 - Define the extra information section for the poem\n$(\"#info\").html(\"\u003cp\u003eExtra info will go here.\u003c/p\u003e\");\n\n// Part 2 - Display the first line of the poem and access info from the poem object if it exists\nlet line1, line1Text;\nline1 = [{text:  \"What\", info: \"Anaphora: The repetition of a word or phrase at the beginning of (usually successive) lines. For example, the use of What in the first four lines.\"}, \n    {text: \"hurrying\"}, {text: \"human\"}, {text: \"tides,\"}, \n    {text: \"or\"}, {text: \"day\"}, {text: \"or\"}, {text: \"night!\"}];\nline1Text = \"\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003e\"; \nline1.map(function(word){\n  let wordString;\n  wordString = word.text;\n  if (word.info){\n    wordString = \"\u003ca href='#' data-info='\"+ word.info + \"'\u003e\" + wordString + \"\u003c/a\u003e\";\n  }\n  line1Text = line1Text + wordString + \" \";\n});\n$(\"#poem\").html(line1Text);\n\n// Part 3 - Add the click event listener to the poem\n$(\"#poem a\").click(function(){\n    let infoText, clickedWord, clickedInfo;\n    clickedWord = $( this ).text();\n    clickedInfo = $( this ).data(\"info\");\n    infoText = clickedInfo;\n    $(\"#info\").html(infoText);\n  });\n```\n\nI have deleted all the earlier comments, so just look at the three new ones I've added here. We can see that we have 3 parts to our program:\n- Part 1 - Define the extra information section for the poem\n- Part 2 - Display the first line of the poem and access `info` from the poem object if it exists\n- Part 3 - Add the click event listener to the poem\n\nIt is clear that we'll need to revamp part 2 to display the full data from the JSON file instead of just the first line we manually inputted. Let's do just that. We'll use the `getJSON` method to retrieve the data from the JSON file. We'll also create a new variable that will store all the text of the poem garnered from the JSON file.\n\n```JavaScript\n//Part 1 - Define the extra information section for the poem\n$(\"#info\").html(\"\u003cp\u003eExtra info will go here.\u003c/p\u003e\");\n\n// Part 2 - Display the first line of the poem and access info from the poem object if it exists\n$.getJSON(\"poem.json\", function(data){ // data variable is the JSON object\n  let poemText; // Define a new variable to hold all text\n  poemText = \"\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003e\"; // Open the starting tags\n  // Now you can iterate (map) over the data variable’s .lines property:\n  data.lines.map(function(line){ // We get a variable, line\n    // Define a blank lineText.\n    let lineText = \"\";\n    // Now iterate over each word. This part should be familiar to you from before\n    line.map(function(word){\n      let wordString;\n      wordString = word.text;\n      if (word.info){\n        wordString = \"\u003ca href='#' data-info='\" + word.info + \"'\u003e\" + wordString + \"\u003c/a\u003e\";\n      }\n      lineText = lineText + wordString + \" \"; // Add the word to the lineText variable with spacing\n    });\n    // Add lineText with a line break to the poemText\n    poemText = poemText + lineText + \"\u003cbr/\u003e\";\n  });\n  // Close the poemText tags\n  poemText = poemText + \"\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\";\n  // Replace the content of #poem\n  $(\"#poem\").html(poemText);\n  // Now that we have the data, we can add the click event listener to the poem\n  $(\"#poem a\").click(function(){\n    let infoText, clickedWord, clickedInfo;\n    clickedWord = $( this ).text();\n    // .data(\"info\") looks for the data-info HTML attribute\n    clickedInfo = $( this ).data(\"info\");\n    infoText = clickedInfo;\n    $(\"#info\").html(infoText);\n  });\n}); // Close the getJSON method and callback function\n```\n\nThere is some new syntax and logic here, so try to follow along with the comments. We're first using a selector and the `getJSON()` method to retrieve the data from the JSON file. `getJSON()` takes two arguments: the source of the JSON file, and what's called a __callback function__. Callback functions are functions that are passed in as arguments to other functions. In this case, we're passing in a function that takes one argument, which is the `data` from the JSON file.\n\nIn other words, the essential moves of the code are as follows:\n- Run the `getJSON()` method, passing in the `poem.json` file as the source.\n- Call the callback function, passing in the `data` variable (the JSON object).\n- Create a new variable to hold all the text of the poem.\n- `map()` over the data variable's `lines` property.\n- `map()` over each word in each line.\n- Make elements clickable if they have `info` data.\n- Add each line to the `poemText` variable with a line break, and add the text to the `#poem` element.\n- Run the `click()` method on the `#poem` element, to see if the user clicks on a word.\n\nAll together, your program should now look something like this:\n\n```JavaScript\n//Part 1 - Define the extra information section for the poem\n$(\"#info\").html(\"\u003cp\u003eExtra info will go here.\u003c/p\u003e\");\n\n// Part 2 - Display the poem and allow for clicking on words\n$.getJSON(\"poem.json\", function(data){ // data variable is the JSON object\n  let poemText; // Define a new variable to hold all text\n  poemText = \"\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003e\"; // Open the starting tags\n  // Now you can iterate (map) over the data variable’s .lines property:\n  data.lines.map(function(line){ // We get a variable, line\n    // Define a blank lineText.\n    let lineText = \"\";\n    // Now iterate over each line. This part should be familiar to you from before\n    line.map(function(word){\n      let wordString;\n      wordString = word.text;\n      if (word.info){\n        wordString = \"\u003ca href='#' data-info='\" + word.info + \"'\u003e\" + wordString + \"\u003c/a\u003e\";\n      }\n      lineText = lineText + wordString + \" \"; // Add the word to the lineText variable with spacing\n    });\n    // Add lineText with a line break to the poemText\n    poemText = poemText + lineText + \"\u003cbr/\u003e\";\n  });\n  // Close the poemText tags\n  poemText = poemText + \"\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\";\n  // Replace the content of #poem\n  $(\"#poem\").html(poemText);\n  // Now that we have the data, we can add the click event listener to the poem\n  $(\"#poem a\").click(function(){\n    let infoText, clickedWord, clickedInfo;\n    clickedWord = $( this ).text();\n    // .data(\"info\") looks for the data-info HTML attribute\n    clickedInfo = $( this ).data(\"info\");\n    infoText = clickedInfo;\n    $(\"#info\").html(infoText);\n  });\n}); // Close the getJSON method and callback function\n```\n\nSave and check the page. You should now see the full poem and have a few clickable elements to explore.\n\nCongrats! You now have a workable dataset and some interesting ways to display and interact with it. We've covered quite a lot of new terrain in this lesson, but for the most part, we are still just utilizing the foundational skills and tools you've encountered so far. \n\nIn the next lesson, we'll introduce a brand new tool called Leaflet. We'll learn how to use Leaflet to add interactive maps to our web pages.\n\nBut, as major takeaways from this lesson, just keep in mind that:\n- We usually want to break down data into smaller, discrete pieces we can manipulate\n- JSON allows you to store data in a structured way and work with it\n- Data attributes are used to store extra information that you may want to access or display\n- Events are used to trigger actions when something happens\n\n## Review Questions\n\n1. True or False - `map()` allows you to iterate over an array, but it doesn't return anything.\n\n\u003cQuiz\u003e\n- True\n- False*\n\u003c/Quiz\u003e\n\n2. True or False - We can import a JSON dataset as an `object` in JavaScript.\n\n\u003cQuiz\u003e\n- True*\n- False\n\u003c/Quiz\u003e\n\n3. The following code would affect which element?\n\n\n```JavaScript\n$(\"#poem h3\").click(function(){\n    // some action\n});\n```\n\n\u003cQuiz\u003e\n- The paragraph element\n- The header element*\n- The info element\n- The body element\n\u003c/Quiz\u003e\n\n## Challenges\n\n1. Our poem page is quite bland. Spruce it up however you'd like by marshalling your CSS skills.\n\n2. `.map()` is an important method. Get a little practice in by writing a new function that takes an array of integers and, using `.map()`, returns an array of those integers, doubled. So if we give it [1, 2, 3], we receive, in turn, [2, 4, 6]. Display this info in the console.\n\n\u003cCodeEditor language=\"JavaScript\"\u003e\n\u003c/CodeEditor\u003e\n\n3. `.map()` is similar to another method, `.forEach()`. We haven't covered the latter, but you may encounter it in the wild. Read through [this article](https://codeburst.io/javascript-map-vs-foreach-f38111822c0f) to understand the differences between the two, and to learn a little more about `.map()` specifically.\n\n4. Add a new property to the JSON file that stores a wiki link for a particular literary device (e.g., [here for anaphora](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaphora_(rhetoric)). Create a new data attribute to access this property and add it to the info message that is displayed when clicked. \n\n## Key Terms\n\nDo you recall the meaning of the following terms?\n\n- `.map()`\n- `.join()`\n- `.getJSON()`\n- data attributes\n- events\n- callbacks\n\n# Mapping With Leaflet\n\nThe last lesson exposed us to a variety of good programming practices. For instance, we separated out our data into a JSON file instead of simply creating a `line1`, `line2`, `line3`, ... `line11` set of arrays to populate our poem. While that also would have worked, it is repetitive and inefficient. Instead, we made some basic assumptions about our data (that a `.lines` property could exist as an array of word objects that we could `.map()` over) and followed that approach, creating a new JSON file object. Separating out our logic for the program and the data we were working with is a good example of a __modular__ programming approach:  of separating out our code into smaller building blocks that ultimately work together to create a whole project. We have already been doing this with our HTML, CSS, and JS files, but we can do it with our data as well.\n\nIn this lesson, we'll work with a new tool called __Leaflet__. Leaflet is an open-source JavaScript library (like jQuery) that will help us add interactive maps to our web pages. Interactive maps have become one of the most popular ways to visualize and explore spatial data. What this will ultimately require us to decide is how to aggregate, categorize, combine, and visualize our data. All of these decisions, plus the context of the map on your page, will influence the story that the map tells. Thinking about your data as a story (no matter what the data is), is a good way to reckon with the ethical dimensions of web development.\n\nOn that note, and given current events, it is probably worth mentioning that Leaflet was created by a Ukrainian programmer in Kyiv. On the library's [main page](https://leafletjs.com/), you can read about the maintainers' sentiments on the war. This is a good time to reflect on how even well-established programming libraries can be affected by social and political forces, and also how they can be utilized in ways that were once unimaginable.\n\nKeeping these ideas in mind, let's get started working with Leaflet.\n\n## Web Maps\n\nYou are likely very familiar with web maps. I personally have found myself quite lost in NYC before. While \"being lost\" is not necessarily a bad way of being sometimes, if you have a specific destination (not to mention a certain time) in mind, having a map is quite helpful. You know what I mean--Google or Apple provide us with interactive geo-location almost every second of our lives.\n\nBefore we begin integrating web maps into our project, it might be helpful to consider the basic \"layering\" of a web map. Take a look at the map below. It was created using Leaflet, and you can see some of the code (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) powering it on the side. Click on stuff and zoom and drag around on the map.\n\n\u003cHTMLEditor \u003e\n\n\u003chtml\u003e\n \u003clink rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://unpkg.com/leaflet@1.8.0/dist/leaflet.css\"/\u003e\n \u003cscript src=\"https://unpkg.com/leaflet@1.7.0/dist/leaflet.js\"\u003e\u003c/script\u003e\n    \u003cdiv id=\"map\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/html\u003e\n\u003ccss\u003e\n#map {\n    height: 600px;\n    width: 600px;\n}\n\u003c/css\u003e\n\u003cjavascript\u003e\n```\nvar map = L.map('map').setView([51.505, -0.09], 13);\nL.tileLayer('https://{s}.tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png', {\n\tmaxZoom: 19,\n\tattribution: '\u0026copy; \u003ca href=\"https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright\"\u003eOpenStreetMap\u003c/a\u003e contributors'\n}).addTo(map);\nL.marker([51.5, -0.09]).addTo(map)\n    .bindPopup('Here is a pop-up\u003cbr\u003e on a marker')\n    .openPopup();\n```\n\u003c/javascript\u003e\n\n\u003c/HTMLEditor\u003e\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\nYou'll notice that there are several \"layers\" to this map. Web maps can be layered in many ways, but the most basic can resolve into just a few:\n1. The background or tile layer--the map itself, with all its internal data about streets, boroughs, cities, etc.\n2. The foreground layer--the parts that overlay the map: the markers, lines, and other elements.\n3. The popup layer--the text or notification that appears when you click on a marker or other element on the map.\n4. The control layer--the buttons that control the map, such as the zoom buttons. This layer is usually on top of the other layers.\n\nThese layers all work together to comprise the interactivity of the map. For our purposes, we will mostly work with the foreground layer and the popup layer.\n\n## Getting Started with Leaflet\n\nLeaflet is fairly straightforward to get started with and allows for a wide array of customization.\n\nIf you look at the JavaScript code for the map above, you'll notice a bunch of `L`s. Leaflet creates an object, `L`, that has a bunch of methods that we can use to create and manipulate maps. Our map is, itself, an object. The tile layer? A different object. Markers are objects, polylines are objects, polygons are objects, popups are objects--you get the point. And all these objects have properties and methods we can modify, too.\n\nTo better understand how this all works, let's get to work setting up our own map. Leaflet has an official [quick starter guide here](https://leafletjs.com/examples/quick-start/) that we'll more or less follow, but we'll add some more context. \n\nLet's say we want to add a map of New York to our page with Whitman's _Broadway_ poem. Using Leaflet, let's get a map to show and add a bit of spatial context to our page.\n\n## HTML\n\nFirst, open your `poem.html` file. My recommendation here is to simply overwrite all your existing HTML by copy/pasting the following:\n\n```HTML\n\u003c!doctype html\u003e\n\u003chtml lang=\"en\"\u003e\n  \u003chead\u003e\n    \u003cmeta charset=\"utf-8\"\u003e\n    \u003ctitle\u003eWalt Whitman's Broadway\u003c/title\u003e\n    \u003clink rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://unpkg.com/leaflet@1.8.0/dist/leaflet.css\"\n    integrity=\"sha512-hoalWLoI8r4UszCkZ5kL8vayOGVae1oxXe/2A4AO6J9+580uKHDO3JdHb7NzwwzK5xr/Fs0W40kiNHxM9vyTtQ==\"\n    crossorigin=\"\"/\u003e\n    \u003cscript src=\"https://unpkg.com/leaflet@1.8.0/dist/leaflet.js\"\n    integrity=\"sha512-BB3hKbKWOc9Ez/TAwyWxNXeoV9c1v6FIeYiBieIWkpLjauysF18NzgR1MBNBXf8/KABdlkX68nAhlwcDFLGPCQ==\"\n    crossorigin=\"\"\u003e\u003c/script\u003e\n    \u003clink rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"poem.css\"\u003e\n  \u003c/head\u003e\n  \u003cbody\u003e\n    \u003cdiv class=\"container\"\u003e\n      \u003ch1\u003e\u003cem\u003eBroadway\u003c/em\u003e by Walt Whitman\u003c/h1\u003e\n      \u003cdiv id=\"intro\"\u003e\n        \u003cp\u003eWelcome to the page for Walt Whitman's poem \u003cem\u003eBroadway\u003c/em\u003e.

First, before our `poem.css` file, we added a new `\u003clink\u003e` tag to link to Leaflet's CSS file. You _must_ always include Leaflet's CSS file in the `\u003chead\u003e` section of your documents when adding maps. Also in the `\u003chead\u003e` we added a new `\u003cscript\u003e` tag to link to Leaflet's JavaScript file. _This is also required_ for Leaflet to work.\n\nNext, within our `\u003cdiv\u003e` `container`, we added a new `\u003cdiv\u003e` with an `id` of `map` at the end. This is where we'll put our map. It will appear underneath the poem and info divs. To offset it a bit, we also included a new `\u003ch2\u003e` tag with the text \"Map of New York\" to appear above the map.\n\nLastly, we have added a new `\u003cscript\u003e` tag to link to our own new JavaScript file named `map.js`. This is where we'll add our own JavaScript code for the map.\n\nEverything else in the HTML should be familiar to you. This will be about all the work we need to do on our HTML file in this lesson.\n\n## CSS\n\nThe next step we'll need to take is to specify a height for our map. Leaflet's one demand of CSS is that it be a certain height. We can do this by adding a `height` property to our `#map` id. In your `poem.css` file, add the following:\n\n```CSS\n#map {\n  height: 400px;\n}\n```\n\nYou can change the height to whatever you'd like, but it must be there.\n\nIf you save your files and click \"Go Live\", you should see our new header with a considerable amount of whitespace beneath it. That is where our map will live. Currently, however, the map is not visible. This is because we need to initialize the map in JavaScript.\n\n## Initializing the Map\n\nCreate a new file called `map.js` and add the following:\n\n```JavaScript\n// Create a new Leaflet map\nlet poemMap;\npoemMap = L.map(\"map\");\n```\n\n`poemMap` is now designated an object that we can use to modify the map on the page. Note the syntax: `.map()` is a method that `L` (Leaflet) has that creates a map in the `\u003cdiv\u003e` with the `id` given as the parameter. (`L.map()` here is not to be confused with the ordinary `.map()` method you've seen before!) If you save everything and check the browser, you should see a map element appear.\n\nUnfortunately, the map is currently blank and grey. This is because we have not yet added a tile layer to the map. Remember, the tile or background layer is the map itself, with all its internal data about streets, boroughs, cities, etc.\n\nLet's go ahead and add the tile layer now. Below the initialization of the map, add the following:\n\n```JavaScript\nL.tileLayer('https://{s}.tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png', {\n\tmaxZoom: 18,\n\tattribution: '\u0026copy; \u003ca href=\"https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright\"\u003eOpenStreetMap\u003c/a\u003e contributors'\n}).addTo(poemMap);\n\npoemMap.setView([40.7128, -74.0060], 16);\n```\n\nLet's take a look at what this code does. First, we add a new `.tileLayer` to the map. The first parameter is the URL of the tile layer source (in this case, [openstreetmap.org](https://www.openstreetmap.org/)). The second parameter is an object that contains the following properties:\n\n- `maxZoom`: The maximum zoom level that the map can be zoomed to.\n- `attribution`: The attribution text (to show the source of the map) that appears at the bottom of the map.\n\nWhenever we create a new object like this `tileLayer`, we need to add it to the map. We do this by calling the `.addTo()` method on the object. This method takes one parameter, which is the map we want to add the tile layer to (`poemMap`).\n\nNext, we use the `.setView()` method. This method takes two parameters: an array of the latitude (north-south) and longitude (east-west) of the center of the map, and the zoom level. We set the center of the map to New York City (using its coordinates) and the zoom level to 16. As we specified earlier, the max zoom level here is 18.\n\nIf you save and check your page, you should now see a map with New York City at its center. Nice!\n\n## Adding Markers\n\nBecause our poem is about Broadway, why don't we add a marker to the map indicating where Times Square is located? We can get the official coordinates of Times Square simply by Googling \"Times Square coordinates\". The result is 40.7580 N, and 73.9855 W. Let's add a marker to the map at these coordinates:\n\n```JavaScript\nconst timesSquare = L.marker([40.7580, -73.9855]).addTo(poemMap);\n```\n\nFirst, we create a new `.marker()` object. This object takes one parameter, which is an array of the latitude and longitude of the location we want to mark. We then add this marker to the map.\n\nIf you scroll up on the map or zoom out, you should now see a marker appear at the coordinates. Next, let's add a popup to the marker. To do this, we need to add a `.bindPopup()` method to the marker. This method takes one parameter, which is simply the text we want to appear in the popup.\n\n```JavaScript\ntimesSquare.bindPopup(\"\u003cb\u003eTimes Square\u003c/b\u003e\");\n```\n\nHere we bind the popup to the marker with the bold text \"Times Square\". If you save and click on the marker, you should now see the popup appear.\n\n![Times Square](/images/times-square.png)\n\n## Adding Shapes\n\nBesides popups and markers, you can add shapes to the map like lines, polygons, and circles. Let's add a circle to the map.\n\n```JavaScript\nconst circle = L.circle([40.7580, -73.9855], {\n    color: 'red',\n    fillColor: '#f03',\n    fillOpacity: 0.5,\n    radius: 500\n}).addTo(poemMap);\n```\n\nHere we have added a circle with a radius of 500 meters. The circle is reddish (in terms of both border and fill) and has a 50% opacity so we can see the map underneath. To add the circle, we simply need to specify the coordinates of the center and add it to the map with the `.addTo()` method.\n\nWe can also add polylines to the map. Let's add a polyline from Times Square to the Graduate Center:\n\n```JavaScript\nconst polyline = L.polyline([\n    [40.7580, -73.9855],\n    [40.7486, -73.9840]\n], {\n    color: 'blue'\n}).addTo(poemMap);\n```\n\nHere we simply need to specify the start and end coordinates of the polyline. We can also specify the color of the line.\n\nLines, circles, and polygons are usually used to show a path or provide some contextual boundaries. We can also bind a popup to a line, circle, or polygon. For example, let's add a popup to the line from Times Square to the Graduate Center:\n\n```JavaScript\npolyline.bindPopup(\"\u003cb\u003eTimes Square to the Graduate Center\u003c/b\u003e\");\n```\n\nIf you click on the line on the map, you should now see a popup appear.\n\nYou can similarly add popups to circles and polygons. Let's add a popup to the circle:\n\n```JavaScript\ncircle.bindPopup(\"I'm a circle!\");\n```\n\n## Coordinates and Events\n\nLeaflet has many methods for working with coordinates. For example, we can get the latitude and longitude of a marker by calling the `.getLatLng()` (getLatitudeLongitude) method:\n\n```JavaScript\nconst latLng = timesSquare.getLatLng();\nconsole.log(latLng.lat);\nconsole.log(latLng.lng);\n```\n\nIf you check your console in the browser, you should now see the latitude and longitude of our Times Square marker display.\n\nIf we wanted to pan (or shift the map's view) to Times Square, we could do so by calling the `.panTo()` method on the map:\n\n```JavaScript\npoemMap.panTo(timesSquare.getLatLng());\n```\n\nIf you check your page, you should now see the map shift to the location of the Times Square marker.\n\nEvery time something happens in Leaflet, e.g. the user clicks on a marker or map zoom changes, the corresponding object in Leaflet sends an event which you can access with a function. It allows you to react to user interaction. For example, let's add a function to the map that logs the latitude and longitude of the point on the map that the user clicks on.\n\n```JavaScript\npoemMap.on('click', function(e) {\n    const latLng = e.latlng;\n    console.log(latLng.lat);\n    console.log(latLng.lng);\n});\n```\n\nHere we add a function to the map that is called whenever the user clicks on the map. The `.on()` method takes two parameters: the event name and a function that is called when the event occurs. The event name is `click` and the function has a parameter `e`, which is the map click event object that is created.\n\nWhen the user clicks on the map, the `.on()` method calls the function we defined. We can access these coordinates by getting the `.latlng` (lowercase) property of the `e` object and then the `.lat` and `.lng` properties on the new `.latLng` object. (Note the differences between the new object we create--it has a capital `L` in the name.)\n\nLeaflet has [very extensive documentation](https://leafletjs.com/reference.html) on all its methods, properties, and events that I recommend you look through. We'll discuss more strategies for using documentation in the next lesson, but it's good to take a preliminary look.\n\n## Review Questions\n\n1.

We'll use a dataset of geospatial data to add some more interesting features to our maps. Specifically, we'll use a dataset that defines the locations of neighborhoods across New York City and incorporate it into our project.\n\nUsing this dataset will allow us to:\n- Add neighborhoods boundaries as a new layer to the map\n- Add popups to the neighborhood polygons\n- List all neighborhoods on the page and add buttons and links to pan to each neighborhood's location\n\nBecause we are combining all of the skills we've learned throughout this course, I recommend taking it slowly and carefully. Be sure to understand the concepts, syntax, and major moves of each part before moving on. \n\nWithout further ado, let's get started!\n\n## The Dataset\n\nWe have said that we'd like to use a dataset that defines the locations of neighborhoods across New York City. We'll talk about good ways to find datasets in the coming weeks (as you begin your own final projects), but for now, let's use the dataset [from this source](https://data.beta.nyc/dataset/pediacities-nyc-neighborhoods/resource/35dd04fb-81b3-479b-a074-a27a37888ce7). If you click on the link, you can see a nice map of NYC that shows the boundaries of the neighborhoods. We'll do something similar with this dataset on our own maps.\n\nLet's use the dataset as a local file in our project folder. You can download it from the source website or simply use the download button below:\n\n\u003cDownload files='nycneighborhoods.json'\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\n\nYou'll see that we get a JSON file that contains the data we need. Make sure you save it in your working directory for this course. Let's open this file in VSCode and take a look at it:\n\n![NYC Dataset](/images/nyc-dataset.png)\n\nIt all looks a little confusing, doesn't it? Let's break down what we are seeing here.\n\nThe JSON file we have here is an example of __GeoJSON__. [GeoJSON](https://geojson.org/) is a subset of JSON that defines a set of specifically _geographic_ features. In other words, it is a standardized format for representing spatial data and is used by many different mapping applications.\n\nJust like regular JSON files you have seen, GeoJSON files utilize key-value pairs to define the features.\n\nYou'll notice our dataset is of the _type_ `\"FeatureCollection\"`. This is a special type of JSON object that contains a list or collection of multiple features. Each feature is itself a JSON object that additionally has the key `\"type\"` with a value of `\"Feature\"`. Each feature has a number of properties that define the object. For instance, you can see that we have properties of `neighborhood`, `boroughCode`, `borough`, and `id`. Each of these has a value that we will be able to access and use later. Each feature also has a property called `geometry` that contains the coordinates of the feature (the neighborhood). Each feature is defined as a polygon with an array of coordinates that define the shape of the polygon (the neighborhood in question). Remember that spatial data can be points, lines, or polygons--we are dealing with polygons here because we are circumscribing the shape of each neighborhood. If you scroll through the file, you'll see that we have a feature for each of the neighborhoods in NYC. \n\nOkay, let's prepare our page so we can use the dataset.\n\n## Preparing the Page\n\nLet's create a few new files. First, create a new HTML file in your working directory called `nyc-data.html`. Go ahead and add the following:\n\n```html\n\u003c!doctype html\u003e\n\u003chtml lang=\"en\"\u003e\n  \u003chead\u003e\n    \u003cmeta charset=\"utf-8\"\u003e\n    \u003ctitle\u003eNYC Neighborhoods\u003c/title\u003e\n    \u003clink rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://unpkg.com/leaflet@1.8.0/dist/leaflet.css\"\n    integrity=\"sha512-hoalWLoI8r4UszCkZ5kL8vayOGVae1oxXe/2A4AO6J9+580uKHDO3JdHb7NzwwzK5xr/Fs0W40kiNHxM9vyTtQ==\"\n    crossorigin=\"\"/\u003e\n    \u003clink rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"nyc-data.css\"\u003e\n   \u003cscript src=\"https://unpkg.com/leaflet@1.8.0/dist/leaflet.js\"\n   integrity=\"sha512-BB3hKbKWOc9Ez/TAwyWxNXeoV9c1v6FIeYiBieIWkpLjauysF18NzgR1MBNBXf8/KABdlkX68nAhlwcDFLGPCQ==\"\n   crossorigin=\"\"\u003e\u003c/script\u003e\n  \u003c/head\u003e\n  \u003cbody\u003e\n    \u003cdiv class=\"container\"\u003e\n      \u003ch1\u003eNYC Neighborhoods\u003c/h1\u003e\n      \u003cdiv id=\"map\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n    \u003c/div\u003e\n    \u003cscript src=\"https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.2.1.min.js\"\u003e\u003c/script\u003e\n    \u003cscript src=\"nyc-data.js\"\u003e\u003c/script\u003e\n  \u003c/body\u003e\n\u003c/html\u003e\n```\n\nThis should all be fairly familiar stuff to you. We get the necessary Leaflet and jQuery files, and we add a custom CSS file as well as a new JavaScript file to work with. To be able to navigate to the page, you can simply add another link to it in your `index.html` file, like we did with our poem:\n\n```html\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003ca href=\"nyc-data.html\"\u003eNYC Neighborhoods\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n```\n\nNext, go ahead and create the new CSS file, `nyc-data.css`, and add the following:\n\n```css\n#map { \n    height: 600px; \n    width: 75%;\n}\n```\n\nThis will set the size of the map to be 75% of the width of the page and 600px tall.\n\nNext, create a new JavaScript file, `nyc-data.js`, and add the following to create the initial map:\n\n```JavaScript\nlet nycMap;\nnycMap = L.map(\"map\");\n\n// create tile layer\nL.tileLayer('https://{s}.tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png', {\n\tmaxZoom: 18,\n\tattribution: '\u0026copy; \u003ca href=\"https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright\"\u003eOpenStreetMap\u003c/a\u003e contributors'\n}).addTo(nycMap);\n\nnycMap.setView([40.7128, -74.0060], 16);\n```\n\nCheck to make sure your map displays properly. If so, let's move on to the next step.\n\n## Adding the Data\n\nThere are several different ways we could add this data to our map, but perhaps the simplest way will be to use Leaflet's built-in `L.geoJSON` method. This function takes in a GeoJSON object and adds it to a map.\n\nTo use this method, however, we'll need to make a minor change to our `nycneighborhoods.json` file. In the file itself, we'll want to store the JSON object as a JavaScript variable we can work with.\n\nThe first thing we'll need to do is change the file type from `.json` to `.js`, as a JavaScript file. You can change the file extension easily by simply right-clicking the file in the Explorer Window and selecting Rename. Change the file name to `nycneighborhoods.js`.\n\nNow, in your `nycneighborhoods.js` file, create a new variable at the very top of the file to store the data like so:\n\n```JavaScript\nconst nyc = {\n\"type\": \"FeatureCollection\",\n...\n...\n...\n```\n\nThis allows us to work directly with the `nyc` variable to add the data to our map. There is, however, one more step to take. We'll need to include the dataset as a source in our HTML file. So, in the `\u003chead\u003e` of your `nyc-data.html` file, add the following:\n\n```html\n\u003cscript src=\"nycneighborhoods.js\"\u003e\u003c/script\u003e\n```\n\nNow, we can finally create a new Leaflet layer with the data and add it to our map. In your `nyc-data.js` file, add the following line of code:\n\n```JavaScript\nL.geoJSON(nyc).addTo(nycMap);\n```\n\nThe `nyc` variable we created earlier is the data in our dataset. We can use the `L.geoJSON` method to add this data to our map. If you save and check your page, you should now see the neighborhoods of NYC outlined over the map:\n\n![Nyc Neighborhoods](/images/nyc-neighborhoods1.png)\n\nPretty neat, right? Make sure you are seeing this correctly display before moving on.\n\n## Styling the Data\n\nLet's add a bit of fill color to the polygons to make them stand out:\n\n```JavaScript\n// add some fill color to the map\nL.geoJSON(nyc, {\n    style: function(feature) {\n        return {\n            color: \"blue\",\n            fillColor: \"yellow\",\n            fillOpacity: 0.5\n        };\n    }\n}).addTo(nycMap);\n```\n\nThe `style` function takes in a feature (in this case, our neighborhood polygons) and returns a style object, which we add to our map. The style object here has three properties: `color`, `fillColor`, and `fillOpacity`. The `color` property sets the color of the polygon border, the `fillColor` property sets the color of the polygon interior, and the `fillOpacity` property sets the opacity of the polygon interior.\n\nYou should now see the polygons styled as a pale yellow with a blue border:\n\n![NYC Neighborhoods](/images/nyc-neighborhoods2.png)\n\n## Adding Popups to the Data\n\nLet's add some popups to our map to show the name of each neighborhood. To do this, we'll need to add a new property to our object: `onEachFeature`. This property takes in a function that will be called for each feature (each neighborhood) in the dataset:\n\n```JavaScript\n// show each borough on the map\nL.geoJSON(nyc, {\n    onEachFeature: function(feature, layer) {\n        layer.bindPopup(\"\u003ch3\u003e\" + feature.properties.borough + \"\u003c/h3\u003e \u003chr\u003e \u003ch3\u003e\" + feature.properties.neighborhood + \"\u003c/h3\u003e\");\n    }\n}).addTo(nycMap);\n```\n\nThe `onEachFeature` property takes in a function with two arguments: the feature and the layer. The feature is the neighborhood itself, and the layer is the Leaflet layer that will be added to the map. We can use the `bindPopup` method to add a popup to the layer. Using HTML in the popup, we can display the name of the neighborhood and the borough by getting the `properties` object from the feature and accessing the `borough` and `neighborhood` properties. In between the `\u003ch3\u003e` tags, we can put a horizontal rule `\u003chr\u003e` to separate the borough and neighborhood names. Finally, as always, we add the layer to the map.\n\nIf you save, you should now be able to click on each neighborhood to see a popup with the name of the neighborhood and the borough.\n\n![NYC Neighborhoods](/images/nyc-neighborhoods3.png)\n\nGreat! Now, let's add a bit more functionality to our page.\n\n## Adding Buttons\n\nLet's say we wanted to add a button to our page that pans the map to a particular neighborhood. Let's create a new button in our `nyc-data.html` file, below our map `\u003cdiv\u003e` tag:\n\n```html\n\u003cbutton id=\"pan-to-flatbush\"\u003ePan to Flatbush\u003c/button\u003e\n```\n\nWe can then use jQuery to check for a click event on the button, and find the neighborhood in the dataset:\n\n```JavaScript\n$(\"#pan-to-flatbush\").click(function() {\n    // find flatbush neighborhood property in the dataset\n    let flatbush = nyc.features.find(function(feature) {\n        return feature.properties.neighborhood === \"Flatbush\";\n    });\n    console.log(flatbush);\n});\n```\n\nWe can use the `find` method to find the neighborhood in the dataset that matches the name we want to pan to. The `find` method takes in a function that will be called for each feature (each neighborhood) in the dataset. In this case, we want to find the neighborhood that matches the name \"Flatbush\". The `find` method will return the first neighborhood that matches the function. To see the result, we `console.log()` the neighborhood we find, just to make sure we are pulling in the correct data.\n\nIf you save and click the Flatbush button, you should see the feature object for Flatbush logged to the console:\n\n![Find Flatbush](/images/find_flatbush.png)\n\nPerfect, we have successfully found the neighborhood we want to pan to. Now, let's use the `panTo` method to pan the map to the neighborhood. Let's fill out this section of code to accomplish this:\n\n```JavaScript\n// use jquery to see if flatbush button is clicked\n$(\"#pan-to-flatbush\").click(function() {\n    // find flatbush neighborhood property in the dataset\n    let flatbush = nyc.features.find(function(feature) {\n        return feature.properties.neighborhood === \"Flatbush\";\n    });\n    console.log(flatbush);\n    // find the coordinates of flatbush property\n    let coordinates = nyc.features.find(function(feature) {\n        return feature.properties.neighborhood === \"Flatbush\";\n    }).geometry.coordinates;\n    console.log(coordinates);\n    nycMap.panTo(new L.LatLng(coordinates[0][0][1], coordinates[0][0][0]));\n});\n```\n\nTo pan the map to the neighborhood, we need to find the coordinates of the neighborhood. We can do this by accessing the `geometry` property from the feature and accessing the `coordinates` property. The `coordinates` property is an array of arrays, and we `console.log(coordinates)` to make sure we are pulling in the correct data. We then use the `panTo` method to pan the map to the coordinates.\n\nIf you save and click the Flatbush button, you should see the map pan to Flatbush. It's not perfect (it doesn't pan to the exact center, but to the outer border of the neighborhood), but it's pretty close. To pan exactly to the center of the polygon would require a bit more complex calculations on our part, but this will work for demonstration purposes.\n\n## Listing All Neighborhoods\n\nWe now have a simple external button control that allows us to pan the map to Flatbush. What if we wanted to list _all_ the neighborhoods of NYC and allow the user to click on each to pan to it? \n\nBelow our Flatbush button, let's add a new `\u003cdiv\u003e` for displaying the entire list of neighborhoods:\n\n```html\n\u003cdiv id =\"neighborhoods\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n```\n\nNext, we'll want to loop through the dataset objects, pulling out the neighborhood name from each so we can display it in the list.\n\n```JavaScript\n// get a list of all the neighborhoods in the dataset\nlet neighborhoods = nyc.features.map(function(feature) {\n    return feature.properties.neighborhood;\n}).filter(function(neighborhood) {\n    return neighborhood !== \"\";\n}).sort();\nconsole.log(neighborhoods);\n```\n\nWe can use the `map` method to loop through the dataset and return an array of neighborhood names. The `filter` method then allows us to remove any neighborhoods that are blank (in case there are blank property names in the dataset). We then use the `sort` method to sort the neighborhoods alphabetically. Finally, we `console.log()` the neighborhoods array to make sure we are pulling in the correct data.\n\nIf you check your console, you should see the list of sorted neighborhoods as output:\n\n![Neighborhoods List](/images/neighborhoods_list.png)\n\nLet's go ahead and write these out to our neighborhoods `\u003cdiv\u003e`:\n\n```Javascript\n// display all the neighborhoods in the neighborhoods div\nneighborhoods.forEach(function(neighborhood) {\n    $(\"#neighborhoods\").append(\"\u003ca href ='#'\u003e\u003cli\u003e\" + neighborhood + \"\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\");\n    // display in columns\n    if (neighborhoods.indexOf(neighborhood) % 4 === 0) {\n        $(\"#neighborhoods\").append(\"\u003cbr\u003e\");\n    }\n});\n```\n\nHere we utilize the `forEach` method to loop through the neighborhoods array and `append` each neighborhood to the `\u003cdiv\u003e` with the id of `neighborhoods`. As you may recall from [an earlier lesson's Challenge #3](http://localhost:3000/workshop/Javascript/?page=10), `forEach` is similar to `map()`, with the important difference being that `forEach` does not create a new array (which would be unnecessary in this case). You'll notice that we are surrounding each neighborhood with an `\u003ca href\u003e` tag and a `\u003cli\u003e` (list item) tag. This is because we want to be able to turn each name into a clickable element. We can use the `indexOf` method to find the index of the neighborhood in the array. If the index is divisible by 4, we add a `\u003cbr\u003e` tag to separate the neighborhoods into spaced columns to make things a little easier to read.\n\nTo enable a basic columnar structure, we also need to add a line of code to our `nyc-data.css` file:\n\n```CSS\n#neighborhoods {\n    columns: 100px 3\n}\n```\n\nThis allows us to create a simple columnar structure with 3 columns, each 100px wide.\n\nIf you save all files and check your page, you should see the list of neighborhoods displayed in columns:\n\n![Neighborhoods List](/images/neighborhoods_list_columns.png)\n\nYou'll notice that there are several duplicates in the dataset (e.g., Jamaica Bay, Broad Islands, Pelham Islands, etc.), and that we are not always getting groups of 4. The data probably needs to be cleaned up (in this case, removing redundancies), which is always a good idea when working with data in your actual projects. We won't worry about this for now.\n\nIn any case, we now have a full list of clickable elements. Finally, let's add a click event to each neighborhood to pan the map to that neighborhood.\n\n```JavaScript\n// if the neighborhood is clicked, find the neighborhood on the map and pan to it\n$(\"#neighborhoods\").on(\"click\", \"li\", function() {\n    let neighborhoodText = $(this).text(); // get the text of the neighborhood\n    let coordinates = nyc.features.find(function(feature) {\n        return feature.properties.neighborhood === neighborhoodText; //check if the text matches the neighborhood in the dataset\n    }).geometry.coordinates; // get the coordinates of the neighborhood\n    nycMap.panTo(new L.LatLng(coordinates[0][0][1], coordinates[0][0][0]));\n    // zoom in\n    nycMap.setZoom(16);\n    // add a marker to the neighborhood polygon\n    L.marker(new L.LatLng(coordinates[0][0][1], coordinates[0][0][0])).addTo(nycMap);\n    // add a popup to the marker\n    L.marker(new L.LatLng(coordinates[0][0][1], coordinates[0][0][0])).bindPopup(\"\u003ch3\u003e\" + neighborhoodText + \"\u003c/h3\u003e\").addTo(nycMap);\n});\n```\n\nWe can use the `.on(click)` method to add a click event to the `\u003cli\u003e` tag (i.e., each neighborhood name). We then use the `$(this).text` method to get the text of the particular `\u003cli\u003e` tag that was clicked. Remember, in this context, `this` simply points to whatever element is being acted upon. It is flexible in that we don't have to specify an individual element of the type. Next, we check if the `neighborhoodText` matches the `neighborhood` property in the dataset. If it does, we can use the `find` method to find the neighborhood in the dataset and grab the coordinates. Using the coordinates, we `panTo` the location. We also zoom in on the neighborhood and add a marker with a popup to the spot.\n\nIf you save your page, you should now be able to click on each neighborhood and the map will automatically zoom toward the neighborhood in question. Cool!\n\nAgain, you'll notice we are not displaying the marker in the exact center of the neighborhood polygon. Because each polygon is differently shaped and built-up from a large variety of coordinates, we'll just place the marker at the border of the neighborhood like we did before. Figuring out how to center each marker would probably be an important task if we were planning to use this website professionally, however.\n\nThe last step we should probably take is to give attribution to our dataset source. Even if the source is open and freely available for use, it's wise to give attribution in case there are mistakes or otherwise undesirable elements in the data. This is not only a way to protect yourself, but also to let others know where to find/work with your data themselves.\n\nFor our purposes, we can simply provide a link to the source at the top of our page, by adding a link below our header:\n\n```HTML\n\u003ca href = \"https://data.beta.nyc/dataset/pediacities-nyc-neighborhoods/resource/35dd04fb-81b3-479b-a074-a27a37888ce7\" alt=\"Data Source\"\u003eHere's the source for NYC neighborhood boundaries.\u003c/a\u003e\n```\n\n## What Have We Done?\n\nLet's take a moment to review the variety of skills and techniques we've utilized to create this new page. Although the page is fairly simple looking, we've accomplished some rather complex tasks. We have:\n\n- A base layer map of the world\n- An overlay of neighborhoods in NYC specifically, using a geospatial dataset\n- The ability to click around on the map and see each neighborhood\n- An external button that allows us to navigate to a particular location on the map, based on the data we have\n- An entire list of clickable neighborhoods pulled from the dataset\n\nWe are only scratching the surface of what jQuery, JSON, and Leaflet can do working in tandem, but we have accomplished quite a lot. These are the skills we'll employ to put together your own final projects with your own datasets, your own stylistic creativity, and your own intentions for the final result.\n\n## Review Questions\n\n1. Each object in a GeoJSON dataset is called a:\n\n\u003cQuiz\u003e\n- Property\n- Feature* \n- Coordinate\n\u003c/Quiz\u003e\n\n2. True or False - The `geometry` property contains coordinate data for a particular feature.\n\n\u003cQuiz\u003e\n- True*\n- False\n\u003c/Quiz\u003e\n\n3. When using a dataset pulled from an online source, it is wise to: (select all that apply)\n\n\u003cQuiz\u003e\n- Check the data for redundancies, duplicates, or otherwise erroneous material*\n- `console.log()` your retrievals of the data for testing purposes*\n- Give attribution for your source*\n\u003c/Quiz\u003e\n\n\n## Challenges\n\n1. Create another button that pans the map to your favorite neighborhood.\n\n2. Draw some polylines to connect the boundaries of different neighborhoods.\n\n3. If a neighborhood is in Manhattan, change the color of the neighborhood polygons to red. (Hint: You'll need to check for the `borough` property and perform `style` changes accordingly.)\n\n## Key Terms\n\nDo you recall the meaning of the following terms?\n\n- GeoJSON\n- FeatureCollections/Features\n- Geometry\n\n# Reading Documentation\n\nThroughout this course, we have often referred you to \"the documentation\" for various libraries and tools. As you may have experienced when looking through these resources, documentation can be overwhelmingly large, complex, and confusing. Learning to read documentation is an important skill, but it's one that takes time.\n\nSo, in this lesson, we'll look to some strategies to help you:\n1. Better navigate through technical jargon.\n2. Better understand the structure and style of documentation.\n3. Feel more confident in your ability to read documentation overall.\n\n## What is Documentation?\n\nDocumentation, at its core, is a collection of descriptions/explanations for employing a particular product or service. Unfortunately, documentation can run the gamut from being very thorough to very vague. Oftentimes, the more niche a product is, and the smaller the community, the less in-depth the documentation. \n\nThis is also, partly, due to the nature of documentation's audience. If documentation is too overly thorough in its explanations, experienced developers might find it bloated. On the other hand, if documentation is too sparse, new developers might find it difficult to understand. Writing efficient documentation means hitting the sweet spot between thoroughness, understandability, and ease of use.\n\n## \"Getting Started\" vs. \"Documentation\"\n\nMost documentation for a tool has two separate sections, written from different perspectives.\n\n1. \"Getting Started\" is a section that describes how to get started using the tool. It is meant to be a quick introduction for how to install, configure, and use the product in a basic way. Leaflet's [\"Quick Start\" guide](https://leafletjs.com/examples/quick-start/) is a good example of this, with basic comprehension and implementation instructions.\n2. Compare, now, Leaflet's Quick Start to [Leaflet's full docs](https://leafletjs.com/reference.html). This is more like a dictionary or glossary of presets, methods, and actions. Information density is prioritized rather than presenting a readable tutorial you can follow along with directly.\n\n## The Art of ~~Reading~~ Referencing\n\nFor the most part, documentation isn't meant to be \"read\" in the traditional sense. Rather, it is meant to be _referenced_. If you have a sense of the overall structure, you can usually jump through non-chronologically. Using \u003ckbd\u003ectrl\u003c/kbd\u003e + \u003ckbd\u003ef\u003c/kbd\u003e to maneuver through search terms is often the best approach.\n\nLet's take a look at the [CSS reference docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference). It is, in short, overwhelming. It contains the full list of CSS properties and values, as well as a lot of information about them. However, if we want to achieve something simple, such as changing the font properties of a particular piece of text, we can simply \u003ckbd\u003ectrl\u003c/kbd\u003e + \u003ckbd\u003ef\u003c/kbd\u003e `font` to find all the relevant properties:\n\n![MDN font](/images/mdn-font.png)\n\nThis is a good example of how documentation works. The baseline property, in this case, `font`, is our first highlighted result. Everything else is in some sense a derivative of the baseline property; for instance, we can specify directly the font size, the weight, the [kerning](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font-kerning), etc. \n\nIn general, when searching for terms, first look to the most basic (i.e., probably the least wordy and jargony) instance. It will likely provide you with the foundational concept of the language that you're looking for and let you expand upon it.\n\nHere is a list of reference docs for the tools we are using in this course. Spend a little bit of time looking at each one, discerning its structure and how you can best use it. Search around for some terms and click/scroll around to see what comes up.\n\n- [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference)\n- [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML)\n- [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference)\n- [jQuery](https://api.jquery.com/)\n- [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/reference.html)\n- [JSON](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON)\n\nThe MDN reference docs are usually the most comprehensive, and besides searching for terms you can also use the sidebar to navigate through additional resources. This is also the case with the Leaflet and jQuery docs.\n\nIf you ever find yourself without internet and need offline documentation, one useful tool is [Zeal](https://zealdocs.org/), an offline documentation browser. It contains most (although not all) of the docsets for the tools and languages that we've used in this course so far.\n\n## Beyond the Docs\n\n### Google Searches\n\nThere are a number of reasons why learning with official documentation is the best approach for really coming to grips with a language. However, we may have inflated this a little. While documentation is best utilized when you have a very specific end goal, and when you already have a basic sense of how this goal might be accomplished, these factors may not always be in place. Especially when you are first starting out with a language or tool, you may not know the best search parameters to use in docs. \n\nIf you aren't quite sure what you are looking for (and \u003ckbd\u003ectrl\u003c/kbd\u003e + \u003ckbd\u003ef\u003c/kbd\u003e isn't being helpful), simply Googling around is the best way to go when faced with a particular problem. There are, however, some best practices for this as well. \n\nFor example, let's say you created a button on a page, and you wanted to add some space around it so other elements aren't cramming it. How would you go about doing this? What sort of keywords would you use? What language is suitable?\n\nProgramming isn't always that different from other software contexts you have encountered. Thinking about the typical Word or Google doc you might write, when thinking about space around something you are probably dealing with `margins` in some form. Aside from \u003ckbd\u003ectrl\u003c/kbd\u003e + \u003ckbd\u003ef\u003c/kbd\u003e `margin` in the docs, you could also turn to Google. In this case your search parameters could be something like: \"adding margins around a button css\", or even simply, \"adding space around a button css.\" Note that although Google will likely figure it out, we are explicitly searching here for CSS. Specifying the language is important, as it will help us narrow down our search results.\n\n### Handling Errors\n\nWe have talked about the basics of understanding errors before, but its worth noting that documentation often provides info on how to deal with possible errors that may arise in a program. There may be errors that can arise that are specific to the tool, and the docs can be the best place to go when dealing with these issues. However, this may not always be the case. If the docs are less than clear, again, simply Googling a confusing error message can be a useful approach if it has you stumped. This is not necessarily to say you should simply copy/paste an entire error. For example, copy/pasting this behemoth of an error message...\n    \n```\nUncaught (in promise) TypeError: _super.call is not a function\n    at new ObservableQuery (b1f6a7d9f98d979758232d0dc3c394ce.js:26213)\n    at QueryManager.watchQuery (b1f6a7d9f98d979758232d0dc3c394ce.js:27305)\n    at b1f6a7d9f98d979758232d0dc3c394ce.js:27332\n    at new Promise (\u003canonymous\u003e)\n    at QueryManager.query (b1f6a7d9f98d979758232d0dc3c394ce.js:27330)\n    at ApolloClient.query (b1f6a7d9f98d979758232d0dc3c394ce.js:27981)\n    at Object.require.2.react (b1f6a7d9f98d979758232d0dc3c394ce.js:29740)\n    at newRequire (b1f6a7d9f98d979758232d0dc3c394ce.js:41)\n    at require.39 (b1f6a7d9f98d979758232d0dc3c394ce.js:66)\n    at b1f6a7d9f98d979758232d0dc3c394ce.js:71\n```\n\n... would not give you very good results. A solution might be to:\n\n1. First, articulate your code that's breaking into a series of smaller steps. Often, programmers recommend a method called [Rubber Duck Debugging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging). This is a technique similar to writing pseudo-code, in that you first try to articulate your problem in spoken or written natural language. Attempting to explain the problem in simple language will very often lead you to a solution, or the beginning of a solution. In describing what the code is supposed to do and observing what it actually does, any incongruity between these two becomes apparent. \n\n2. Second, begin your search. Hopefully you now have a rough idea of what your code is and isn't doing correctly, so begin by including keywords from your error message and try to find results that fit your particular use case. For example, in the error above, if you Google \"javascript uncaught (in promise) typeerror\", you will find quite a few people have run into the same problem!\n\nThe first hit of this result is [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57673148/how-to-fix-uncaught-in-promise-typeerror-cannot-read-property-method-of-un) question on the notorious Stack Overflow. Its worth taking a minute to discuss this site.\n\n![Stack Overflow](/images/error_google.png)\n\n### Stack Overflow\n\nStack Overflow is a very commonly used resource for programmers. It is a great place to find answers to all kinds of questions, and even to share your knowledge with others if you feel up to it. It is essentially a question/answer forum, and, at this point, contains over 21 million programming questions. If you have a question or issue about your code, it is very likely someone else has had it too. Whether or not you will always find an answer to your problem is more dubious, but it can be informational in other ways as well.  \n\nLet's say we wanted to figure out how to disable a button using jQuery (for instance, a \"submit\" button that only works when a form is filled out on the page). We could search for \"disable button jquery\" in Google. The first hit of this result is not actually pointing us to documentation, but rather to [this Stack Overflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1594952/jquery-disable-enable-submit-button/62723465#62723465).\n\n![Stack Overflow](/images/stack_overflow_example.png)\n\nAlways, take a quick look at the question to make sure it's relevant to your problem. Then scroll down through the answers and the discussions to find what you're looking for. You may also notice snarky debates—another \"feature\" of Stack Overflow. In this particular case, there are many, many answers, and almost each one is a different way to solve the problem. It is worth pointing out that this question was asked over 12 years ago, which is something you might want to consider, as some things may possibly be out of date. In any case, there is a plethora of information on the page that should help point you in the right direction.\n\nAs you might imagine, implementing code snippets from Stack Overflow is an incredibly common practice, and is even the source of many jokes, like this meme:\n\n![Joke](/images/so_joke.jpg)\n\nDon't feel the need to reinvent the wheel if you find a working solution on Stack Overflow. However, do pay close attention to any code you wrangle with, and make sure you understand what it is doing and how it fits into your overall program/project.\n\n### Other Resources\n\nWhile Stack Overflow is a great resource for programmers, it is not the only resource. There are many, many others, like [GitHub](https://github.com/), [CodeProject](https://www.codeproject.com/), different subreddits (like r/webdev, r/learnjavascript, etc.) on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/), and much more.\n\nIf you would like to go really in-depth learning Leaflet, I would highly recommend Malcom Maclean's [Leaflet Tips and Tricks](https://leanpub.com/leaflet-tips-and-tricks/read).\n\n## Final Thoughts\n\nIn general, keep in mind that documentation is best used as a reference for what you can do with a particular piece of software. It is not always the best place to start for beginners, but you will likely always end up arriving at the official documentation in one way or another. Beyond that, simply Googling around can be a good jumping off point. The absolute most important thing to learn is how to find answers to your questions. This means learning how to ask the _right_ questions. As a recap, when searching, be sure to:\n1. Include the language/tool you are searching in as a search parameter.\n2. Break down your search into keywords.\n3. Be specific.\n4. Don't be afraid to copy/paste and tweak results to fit your programs, but be sure to understand what the code is doing as best you can.\n\nAs you begin putting together your final project in the remaining weeks, try to keep these resources and strategies in mind, and refer back to them as needed.\n\n## Review Questions\n\n1. You should read documentation straight through, from top to bottom.\n\n\u003cQuiz\u003e\n- True\n- False*\n\u003c/Quiz\u003e\n\n2. You should copy and paste your entire error message when searching for guidance through Google.\n\n\u003cQuiz\u003e\n- True\n- False*\n\u003c/Quiz\u003e\n\n3. To get the most out of your Google searches, you should: (select all that apply)\n\n\u003cQuiz\u003e\n- Include the target language/tool you are searching in as a search parameter.*\n- Break down your search into keywords.*\n- Be specific.*\n- Say please.\n\u003c/Quiz\u003e\n\n## Challenges\n\nHere's a basic rectangle class in HTML:   \n\n```HTML\n\u003cdiv class=\"rectangle\"\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003eI am a rectangle\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n```\n\n1. Using this [CSS reference guide](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/), look into how you might do the following: \n    1. Give the rectangle a width, height, and background color.\n    2. Give the box a thick border.\n    3. Center the rectangle on the page.\n    4. Center the \"I am a rectangle\" text within the rectangle.\n    5. Add a drop shadow to the rectangle.\n\n2. Using the [jQuery reference](https://api.jquery.com/), look into how you might do the following:\n    1. Check if the user has pressed the \u003ckbd\u003eenter\u003c/kbd\u003e key on the keyboard.\n    2. Add a hover event to an element (like a button) so that it will change color when the mouse is hovering over it.\n    3. Scroll to the top of the page if the user clicks a button.\n\n3. Using the [JavaScript reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference) and/or Google, look into how you might do the following:\n    1. Find the index of a substring within a string (like \"dog\" in \"The dog jumped.\").\n    2. Given an array of numbers (e.g., `[40, 38, 37, 93, 55, 66]`, filter out any values that are less than 50.\n    3. Given a decimal number (like `.36`), round it up to the nearest whole number.\n    4. Create a random number between 1 and 100.\n\n## Key Terms\n\n- Documentation\n- Reference\n- Rubber Duck Debugging \n\n# Starting Your Project \n\nCongratulations on making it this far! We've covered quite a lot of ground in a rather short amount of time. At this point, you should be well-equipped to get your hands dirty starting your own projects. \n\nThat being the case, the remaining few weeks will be entirely devoted to working on your own projects. Your projects will largely be self-directed, based on your own particular creative aspirations or research interests. There are, however, a few requirements. Let's go through them.\n\n## Project Requirements\n\nYour projects should demonstrate that you understand the major concepts covered in this course. At a baseline level, this means your project should include:\n\n- A homepage that includes a brief description of your project and its purpose.\n- Interactive content that allows the user to explore the project (buttons, links, images, text, etc).\n- Dataset(s) pertinent to the project, whether it be data you've created yourself, or data you've imported from a data source.\n- Some sort of visualization of the data you are working with (e.g., a map).\n- A style appropriate to the project or to your personal aesthetic tastes.\n- A new GitHub repository dedicated to the project and a working version that you can share with others.\n\nDepending on the kind of project you are creating, it might be weighted towards one or more of these requirements over the others. This is fine, as long as you are, again, able to show that you understand the material we've covered.\n\n## Project Components\n\nThe above requirements will expect you to demonstrate knowledge with JavaScript, HTML, CSS, jQuery, JSON, Leaflet, and GitHub. In other words, in practical terms your project will be comprised of _at least_ one of each of the following:\n\n- HTML file\n- CSS file\n- JavaScript file\n- JSON file\n- Leaflet map\n- GitHub repository\n\nKeep in mind that all of these components are meant to _work together_ to tell a particular story or demonstrate a particular idea or purpose.\n\nIt will be up to you to decide how you want to structure your project. Will it be comprised of multiple web pages? Will it be a single web page with multiple components? The design will probably depend on your own creative ideas, the kind of project you are developing, and your ultimate goals for the user of the site. We'll talk through some strategies for putting your site together next week, but it will be helpful to have some idea of how you might structure your project before you begin writing any code.\n\n## Project Ideas\n\nAs mentioned, your projects are self-directed and individually tailored. The content and structure of your site can be based on whatever you'd like. However, let's discuss some ideas to help you get off the ground.\n\nAs a starting point for your projects, ask yourself: \n\n1. What kind of story do I want to tell?\n2. What kind of data will I need?\n3. What kind of visualizations will I want?\n4. How will the website be structured?\n5. How will the user interact with the website?\n\nHere are some sample ideas for projects:\n\n- An exploration of an essay, poem, or work of fiction\n- A Choose Your Own Adventure game\n- A walking tour of the city\n- An exploration of green spaces, parks, wildlife, etc.\n- An exploration of libraries, archives, or museums\n- Observations/celebrations of ethnic or cultural diversity\n- Observations on geography and political affiliations, income levels, access to healthcare, etc.\n- An investigation of the impacts of climate change\n\nThese are just suggestions, but feel free to use them as a starting point. For example, let's say you wanted to create a walking tour. What might your site consist of? A few things off the top of my head could be:\n\n- Polylines indicating the tour on a map\n- A dataset with coordinates of the walk and interesting features along the way\n- Markers and popups giving information on the map\n- Images to show some of the views of the walk\n- Text to describe the walk\n- Links to landmarks, businesses (restaurants, bars, cafes) etc. along the way\n\nThese are just basic elements that could be the foundation of an interesting guided tour. Feel free to get creative and expand on your ideas to make something particularly unique!\n\n## Project Scope\n\nIt is very important to keep in mind that there are only a few weeks remaining in the semester. While it is fine to have big ideas and plans for your project, be very mindful of the __scope__ of your project and what you can actually accomplish in the allotted time. In other words, try to narrow down your project to a _single achievable goal_. Creating big, complex, beautiful websites takes a lot of time and effort, and is not necessarily the point of this project. \n\nInstead, try to provide major milestones for yourself to work towards that comprise the essential parts of your project. Keep your project goals direct, to the point, and attuned to the project requirements. You can always build upon your work later, but don't get bogged down in too much detail or minor features until you have a sufficient working version of the site.\n\n## Where to Find Data?\n\nOkay, now that we've discussed some of the basics for your project, let's look to some ways to gather data. Depending on your project, you might be gathering/creating your dataset yourself, or you might be importing data from a source online. For the latter option, here are a few recommendations for finding datasets:\n\n- [NYC Open Data](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/): Official source for data in New York City.\n- [USGS (United States Geological Survey)](https://www.usgs.gov/): Official source for geological data in the United States.\n- [Google's Dataset Search](https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/): Search for datasets on Google.\n- [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets): Search for a variety of datasets on Kaggle.\n- [Data.gov](https://www.data.gov/): US Gov data covering everything from climate change to crime.\n- [Datahub.io](https://datahub.io/): Mostly business and finance datasets\n- [EarthData](https://earthdata.nasa.gov/): NASA data\n- [Data.world](https://data.world/): Data from various sources\n\nEach of these websites has a search engine that can help you find datasets that you might be interested in. In general, keep in mind that we want to use JSON files. Some sites will give you an option of multiple formats. If not, you may want to convert the data into JSON. For instance, if you encounter CSV files (which is common), you can use the [CSVtoJSON](https://csv.keyangxiang.com/) tool to convert the data into JSON. There are many online converters out there, so don't be discouraged if your data is not in a format you want.\n\nOkay, enough prepping. Let's get started! Attempt the Challenges below to get going with your ideas. __Above all, remember to have fun with your projects!__\n\n## Challenges\n\n1. Write a short project proposal to share your ideas with the class (a paragraph or two will suffice).\n\n2. Begin gathering or creating a dataset relevant to your ideas.\n\n3. Create a new folder and a new GitHub repository for the project. Begin uploading your essential files you'll be working with (an HTML file, a CSS file, a JS file, your data, etc.). If you need a refresher with GitHub, review the [GitHub lesson](http://localhost:3000/workshop/Javascript/?page=7).\n\n# Putting the Project Together\n\nHopefully you have a good idea of what you'd like your project to achieve. While there is no one right answer for how to structure your project, there are some best practices that you can employ to help you envision the final product. In this lesson, we'll cover a few strategies for thinking about your project holistically.\n\n## Wireframing\n\n__Wireframing__ is the practice of creating a rough outline of a project in order to help you visualize the final product. It usually involves drawing a basic sketch of what the project will look like and figuring out minor details later on. This helps determine how the information is presented and how the various bits of information interact. Because this entanglement of information is the center of wireframing, there is no focus on fonts or colors or graphics. For instance, here's a basic wireframe for YouTube culled from [this site](https://www.visual-paradigm.com/learning/handbooks/agile-handbook/wireframe.jsp):\n\n![Wireframe](/images/wireframe_example.png)\n\nIf you've ever used modern-day YouTube, this should be pretty familiar to you. It highlights only the essential aspects of what the site is meant to accomplish and what the user experience should be. Again, the point of wireframing is to help you visualize the final product; in other words, it serves as a blueprint for design. For your project, it can help you plan out:\n\n- __Content:__ What content will be displayed?\n- __Structure:__ How are the pieces of the application fitting together?\n- __Information Hierarchy:__ How is the information organized and displayed together? What is most important?\n- __Functionality:__ How will the overall interface work?\n- __Behavior:__ How will the users interact with the interface? What will be the results?\n\nTry grabbing a notebook or using this site to draw a simple wireframe for your project.\n\n## CSS Styling\n\nRemember flexboxes? They will likely come in handy in allowing you to effectively structure the content of your pages. [See this resource](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout/Relationship_of_Grid_Layout) and [this resource](https://webdesign.tutsplus.com/articles/flexbox-vs-css-grid-which-should-you-use--cms-30184) to learn about the differences between `grid` and `flexbox`. \n\n## Accessibility\n\n\nbreak your project down into steps \n\nShowing/hiding data - keep things from getting too cluttered\n\nIf you are trying to figure something out, review the lessons from this course, check documentation, or search the web. Keep in mind the strategies we've discussed in the [Reading Documentation]() lesson.\n\nCollaborative coding\n\n# Going Live\n\n\n\nUp to this point our work has faded into the past at every screen refresh. Ephemerality is not a feature much appreciated in programming. To get started on something more permanent, let's set up a practice folder to hold our code. Call it `javascript`, or whatever you want, as long as you promise to remember it. Throughout this class, we will be working in this folder.\nClick this button to download a couple of files we'll be needing. Add them to your working folder.\n\u003cDownload files='index.html, script.js'\u003e\n\n## The HTML\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst we need to understand the HTML. HTML is the markup language that is used to create web pages. It is a simple language that is used to describe the structure of a web page. \n    \n```html\n\u003c!doctype HTML\u003e\n\u003chtml lang=\"en\"\u003e\n  \u003chead\u003e\n    \u003cmeta charset=\"utf-8\"\u003e\n    \u003ctitle\u003eMy JavaScripting Master's Student Project\u003c/title\u003e\n  \u003c/head\u003e\n  \u003cbody\u003e\n    \u003ch1\u003eThis is my project!\u003c/h1\u003e\n    \u003cdiv id=\"response\"\u003eThis is the #response div.\u003c/div\u003e\n    \u003cscript src=\"https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.2.1.min.js\"\u003e\u003c/script\u003e\n    \u003cscript src=\"scripts.js\"\u003e\u003c/script\u003e\n  \u003c/body\u003e\n\u003c/html\u003e\n```\n\n## The JavaScript\n\n```javascript\nalert('Hey, it worked!');\n```\n\n\u003cJSConsole /\u003e\n\n\n\nLoops are a way to repeat a block of code a certain number of times. Deciding when and how often to repeat a block of code is a huge part of what makes programming useful. One key concept of looping is 'iteration'. Iteration is moving through a series of items, one at a time. Here is an example of a loop iterating through a list of numbers:\n\n```javascript\nvar numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\nfor (var i = 0; i \u003c numbers.length; i++) {\n    console.log(numbers[i]);\n}\n```\n\nNotice that we set a variable called `i` to 0. This is called the 'initialization' of the loop. We then set the condition that the loop will run as long as `i` is less than the length of the array. This is called the 'test'. We then increment `i` by 1. This is called the 'update'. We use that index to get the value at that index in the array. So, in order, we initialize, test, and update.\n\nLet's talk through the loop we made. First, we initialize the loop. We set `i` to 0. Then, we test the condition. We check to see if `i` is less than the length of the array. If it is, we move on to the next step. If it isn't, we exit the loop. Then, we update the loop. We increment `i` by 1. We repeat the loop until `i` is greater than or equal to the length of the array. Inside the loop, we use the index `i` to get the value at that index in the array. So, we get the value at index 0, then the value at index 1, then the value at index 2, etc.\n\nLet's add a loop to our index.html file. We'll use the same code as before, but this time we'll add a button to the page that will run the loop.\n\n## The HTML\n\n```html\n\u003c!doctype HTML\u003e\n\u003chtml lang=\"en\"\u003e\n    \u003chead\u003e\n        \u003cmeta charset=\"utf-8\"\u003e\n        \u003ctitle\u003eMy JavaScripting Master's Student Project\u003c/title\u003e\n        \u003cscript src=\"https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.2.1.min.js\"\u003e\u003c/script\u003e\n        \u003cscript src=\"scripts.js\"\u003e\u003c/script\u003e\n    \u003c/head\u003e\n    \u003cbody\u003e\n        \u003ch1\u003eThis is my project!\u003c/h1\u003e\n        \u003cdiv id=\"response\"\u003eThis is the #response div.\u003c/div\u003e\n        \u003cbutton id=\"button\"\u003eClick me!\u003c/button\u003e\n    \u003c/body\u003e\n\u003c/html\u003e\n```\n\n## The JavaScript\n\n```javascript\nvar numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\n$('#button').click(function() {\n    for (var i = 0; i \u003c numbers.length; i++) {\n        console.log(numbers[i]);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nSee how we're connecting the button to the loop? We're using the `$` function to select the element with the id `button`. We're also using the `click` function to run the loop when the button is clicked.\n\n\n\nFunctions are a way to group code together. They are useful for keeping your code organized. They are also a great way to reuse code. Here's an example:\n\n```javascript\nfunction add(a, b) {\n    return a + b;\n}\n```\n\nThis function is called `add`. It takes two parameters, `a` and `b`. It then returns the sum of `a` and `b`. What does it mean to `return` something? Let's take a look:\n\n```javascript\nvar newValue = add(1, 2);\nconsole.log(newValue);\n```\n\nWhat does `newValue` equal? It equals 3. This is because we called the function `add` with the parameters 1 and 2, which returned 3. So, returning something is a way to get the value of something, just like getting the end result of a calculation.\n\nSo, you could call this function a machine that adds two numbers. Let's talk about the syntax:\n\n```javascript\n    `function name(parameter1, parameter2) {`\n    `    code to run`\n    `}`\n``` \n\nInside the parentheses, we're defining the parameters. This is just like defining variables, but they're used to pass values into the function. Let's try it out.\n\n```javascript\nvar firstNumber = 1;\nvar secondNumber = 2;\nvar c = add(firstNumber, secondNumber);\nconsole.log(c);\n```\n\nThis is something that all learning programmers have to wrap their head around. INSIDE the function, `firstNumber` and `secondNumber` are known as `a` and `b`. We're calling the function `add` and passing `a` and `b` into it. The function then returns the sum of `a` and `b`. This move is confusing at first, but is key to understanding how functions work. Let's try another one.\n\n```javascript\nfunction howFeel(mood) {\n    if (mood === 'happy') {\n        return 'I feel happy!';\n    } else if (mood === 'sad') {\n        return 'I feel sad!';\n    } else {\n        return 'I feel neutral!';\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNotice that we've included an if/else statement. Everything we've learned up to this point can be used in a function. Here's another one, this time looping through a list:\n\n```javascript\nvar NYBoroughs = ['Manhattan', 'Bronx', 'Brooklyn', 'Queens', 'Staten Island'];\nfor (var i = 0; i \u003c NYBoroughs.length; i++) {\n    if (NYBoroughs[i] === 'Queens') {\n        console.log('Queens has the best food!');\n    } else {\n        console.log(NYBoroughs[i]);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n\u003cJSTerminal /\u003e\n\n\u003cCodeEditor language='javascript'\u003e\nvar t = 10;\n\u003c/CodeEditor\u003e\n\n\n\nWhen encountering an error, the browser will stop running the code. It will show an error message. The error will show a few things:\n\n- The line of code that caused the error\n- The error message\n- The stack trace\n\nThere are a few main types of errors:\n\n- Syntax errors\n- Runtime errors\n- Logical errors\n\nSyntax errors are when the code is not written correctly. Runtime errors are when the code is written correctly, but the computer is not able to run it. Logical errors are when the code is written correctly, but the computer is not able to run it because it is not doing what it should.\n\nWhen you have a syntax error, the error report will show you the line of code that caused the error. It is not always clear where the error is. It is often the line of code that comes after the error (??). There are online resources that can help you find the error, such as [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/). Stack Overflow is a great place to find answers to your questions. The people there are not always friendly.\n\nIf you get a runtime error, the error report will show you the line of code that caused the error. It will also show you the error message. The error message is often a little more specific than the line of code. It will also show you the stack trace. The stack trace is a list of the lines of code that were run before the error. It is often helpful to look at the stack trace to see where the error is.\n\nIf you get a logical error, the error report will show you the line of code that caused the error. It will also show you the error message. The error message is often a little more specific than the line of code. It will also show you the stack trace. The stack trace is a list of the lines of code that were run before the error. It is often helpful to look at the stack trace to see where the error is.\n\n\nYou've got to have a webpage with content in it in order to use JavaScript to manipulate it! We're going to use css Grid and Flexbox to get where we're going, so nothing like Bootstrap or etc.\n\n\n\nWe're gonna add some INTERACTIVITY to our project. We're going to add a button to the page that will ask the user for their name. We're going to add a div to the page that will show the user their name. \n\n```html\n\u003c!doctype HTML\u003e\n\u003chtml lang=\"en\"\u003e\n    \u003chead\u003e\n        \u003cmeta charset=\"utf-8\"\u003e\n        \u003ctitle\u003eMy JavaScripting Master's Student Project\u003c/title\u003e\n        \u003cscript src=\"https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.2.1.min.js\"\u003e\u003c/script\u003e\n        \u003cscript src=\"scripts.js\"\u003e\u003c/script\u003e\n    \u003c/head\u003e\n    \u003cbody\u003e\n        \u003ch1\u003eThis is my project!\u003c/h1\u003e\n        \u003cdiv id=\"response\"\u003eThis is the #response div.\u003c/div\u003e\n        \u003cbutton id=\"button\"\u003eClick me!\u003c/button\u003e\n    \u003c/body\u003e\n\u003c/html\u003e\n```\n## The JavaScript\n\n```javascript\n$('#button').click(function() {\n    var name = prompt('What is your name?');\n    $('#response').text(name);\n}\n```\n\n\n\nThe absolute most important thing to learn is how to find answers to your questions. This means learning how to ask the right questions. It comes through practice. Seeing an error\n\n\n\nObjects are a way to store data in a structured way. They are useful for storing data that has a lot of different properties. Here's an example:\n\n```javascript\n    var person = {\n        name: 'Sandra',\n        age: 30,\n        favoriteFood: 'pizza'\n    };\n```\n\nWhat's nice about this is that we can access the properties of the object using dot notation. What is the difference between dot notation and bracket notation? Let's take a look:\n```javascript\n    person.name;\n    person['name'];\n```\n\n\n\nDocumentation exists to explain what a tool is and how to use it. Too often, whether because documentation is an afterthought, or because the people responsible for making it are better programmers than communicators, technical documentation fails to make itself clear. Paradoxically, it is often necessary to already be familiar with using a tool in order to interpret the instructions about how to use it.\n\n\n\nD3 is a JavaScript library that allows you to create visualizations. Other tools are higher-level libraries that have more assumptions about how to use them. D3 is less opinionated about how to use it. It is more flexible. It is more robust. It is more efficient. It is more powerful. BUT it is more complicated. Here's a quick example of how to use D3:\n\n\u003cHTMLEditor \u003e\n\n\u003chtml\u003e\n \u003clink rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://unpkg.com/leaflet@1.8.0/dist/leaflet.css\"/\u003e\n \u003cscript src=\"https://unpkg.com/leaflet@1.8.0/dist/leaflet.js\"\u003e\u003c/script\u003e\n    \u003cdiv id=\"map\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/html\u003e\n\u003ccss\u003e\n#map {\n    height: 400px;\n    width: 400px;\n}\n\u003c/css\u003e\n\u003cjavascript\u003e\n```\nvar map = L.map('map').setView([51.505, -0.09], 13);\nL.tileLayer('https://{s}.tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png', {\n\tmaxZoom: 19,\n\tattribution: '\u0026copy; \u003ca href=\"https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright\"\u003eOpenStreetMap\u003c/a\u003e contributors'\n}).addTo(map);\nL.marker([51.5, -0.09]).addTo(map)\n    .bindPopup('A pretty CSS3 popup.\u003cbr\u003e Easily customizable.')\n    .openPopup();\n```\n\u003c/javascript\u003e\n\n\u003c/HTMLEditor\u003e\n\n","title":"Intro to Javascript","excerpt":"This is a basic introduction to JavaScript, which is the programming language of the web.

S. VERNON JONES\n\n\nWITH AN INTRODUCTION\n\nBY G. K. CHESTERTON\n\n\nAND ILLUSTRATIONS\n\nBY ARTHUR RACKHAM\n\n\n1912 EDITION\n\n\n\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n\n_Æsop embodies an epigram not uncommon in human history; his fame\nis all the more deserved because he never deserved it. The firm\nfoundations of common sense, the shrewd shots at uncommon sense, that\ncharacterise all the Fables, belong not him but to humanity. In\nthe earliest human history whatever is authentic is universal: and\nwhatever is universal is anonymous. In such cases there is always\nsome central man who had first the trouble of collecting them, and\nafterwards the fame of creating them. He had the fame; and, on the\nwhole, he earned the fame. There must have been something great and\nhuman, something of the human future and the human past, in such a\nman: even if he only used it to rob the past or deceive the future.\nThe story of Arthur may have been really connected with the most\nfighting Christianity of falling Rome or with the most heathen\ntraditions hidden in the hills of Wales. But the word \"Mappe\" or\n\"Malory\" will always mean King Arthur; even though we find older and\nbetter origins than the Mabinogian; or write later and worse versions\nthan the \"Idylls of the King.\" The nursery fairy tales may have come\nout of Asia with the Indo-European race, now fortunately extinct; they\nmay have been invented by some fine French lady or gentleman like\nPerrault: they may possibly even be what they profess to be. But we\nshall always call the best selection of such tales \"Grimm's Tales\":\nsimply because it is the best collection.\n\nThe historical Æsop, in so far as he was historical, would seem to\nhave been a Phrygian slave, or at least one not to be specially and\nsymbolically adorned with the Phrygian cap of liberty. He lived, if he\ndid live, about the sixth century before Christ, in the time of that\nCroesus whose story we love and suspect like everything else in\nHerodotus. There are also stories of deformity of feature and a ready\nribaldry of tongue: stories which (as the celebrated Cardinal said)\nexplain, though they do not excuse, his having been hurled over a high\nprecipice at Delphi. It is for those who read the Fables to judge\nwhether he was really thrown over the cliff for being ugly and\noffensive, or rather for being highly moral and correct. But there is\nno kind of doubt that the general legend of him may justly rank him\nwith a race too easily forgotten in our modern comparisons: the race\nof the great philosophic slaves. Æsop may have been a fiction like\nUncle Remus: he was also, like Uncle Remus, a fact. It is a fact that\nslaves in the old world could be worshipped like Æsop, or loved like\nUncle Remus. It is odd to note that both the great slaves told their\nbest stories about beasts and birds.\n\nBut whatever be fairly due to Æsop, the human tradition called Fables\nis not due to him. This had gone on long before any sarcastic freedman\nfrom Phrygia had or had not been flung off a precipice; this has\nremained long after. It is to our advantage, indeed, to realise the\ndistinction; because it makes Æsop more obviously effective than any\nother fabulist. Grimm's Tales, glorious as they are, were collected by\ntwo German students. And if we find it hard to be certain of a German\nstudent, at least we know more about him than We know about a Phrygian\nslave. The truth is, of course, that Æsop's Fables are not Æsop's\nfables, any more than Grimm's Fairy Tales were ever Grimm's fairy\ntales. But the fable and the fairy tale are things utterly distinct.\nThere are many elements of difference; but the plainest is plain\nenough. There can be no good fable with human beings in it. There can\nbe no good fairy tale without them.\n\nÆsop, or Babrius (or whatever his name was), understood that, for\na fable, all the persons must be impersonal. They must be like\nabstractions in algebra, or like pieces in chess. The lion must always\nbe stronger than the wolf, just as four is always double of two. The\nfox in a fable must move crooked, as the knight in chess must move\ncrooked. The sheep in a fable must march on, as the pawn in chess must\nmarch on. The fable must not allow for the crooked captures of the\npawn; it must not allow for what Balzac called \"the revolt of a sheep\"\nThe fairy tale, on the other hand, absolutely revolves on the pivot\nof human personality. If no hero were there to fight the dragons, we\nshould not even know that they were dragons. If no adventurer were\ncast on the undiscovered island--it would remain undiscovered. If the\nmiller's third son does not find the enchanted garden where the seven\nprincesses stand white and frozen--why, then, they will remain white\nand frozen and enchanted. If there is no personal prince to find the\nSleeping Beauty she will simply sleep. Fables repose upon quite the\nopposite idea; that everything is itself, and will in any case speak\nfor itself. The wolf will be always wolfish; the fox will be always\nfoxy. Something of the same sort may have been meant by the animal\nworship, in which Egyptian and Indian and many other great peoples\nhave combined. Men do not, I think, love beetles or cats or crocodiles\nwith a wholly personal love; they salute them as expressions of that\nabstract and anonymous energy in nature which to any one is awful, and\nto an atheist must be frightful. So in all the fables that are or are\nnot Æsop's all the animal forces drive like inanimate forces, like\ngreat rivers or growing trees. It is the limit and the loss of all\nsuch things that they cannot be anything but themselves: it is their\ntragedy that they could not lose their souls.\n\nThis is the immortal justification of the Fable: that we could not\nteach the plainest truths so simply without turning men into chessmen.\nWe cannot talk of such simple things without using animals that do\nnot talk at all. Suppose, for a moment, that you turn the wolf into a\nwolfish baron, or the fox into a foxy diplomatist. You will at once\nremember that even barons are human, you will be unable to forget\nthat even diplomatists are men. You will always be looking for that\naccidental good-humour that should go with the brutality of any brutal\nman; for that allowance for all delicate things, including virtue,\nthat should exist in any good diplomatist. Once put a thing on two\nlegs instead of four and pluck it of feathers and you cannot help\nasking for a human being, either heroic, as in the fairy tales, or\nun-heroic, as in the modern novels.\n\nBut by using animals in this austere and arbitrary style as they are\nused on the shields of heraldry or the hieroglyphics of the ancients,\nmen have really succeeded in handing down those tremendous truths that\nare called truisms. If the chivalric lion be red and rampant, it is\nrigidly red and rampant; if the sacred ibis stands anywhere on one\nleg, it stands on one leg for ever. In this language, like a large\nanimal alphabet, are written some of the first philosophic certainties\nof men. As the child learns A for Ass or B for Bull or C for Cow, so\nman has learnt here to connect the simpler and stronger creatures with\nthe simpler and stronger truths. That a flowing stream cannot befoul\nits own fountain, and that any one who says it does is a tyrant and a\nliar; that a mouse is too weak to fight a lion, but too strong for the\ncords that can hold a lion; that a fox who gets most out of a flat\ndish may easily get least out of a deep dish; that the crow whom the\ngods forbid to sing, the gods nevertheless provide with cheese; that\nwhen the goat insults from a mountain-top it is not the goat that\ninsults, but the mountain: all these are deep truths deeply graven on\nthe rocks wherever men have passed. It matters nothing how old they\nare, or how new; they are the alphabet of humanity, which like so\nmany forms of primitive picture-writing employs any living symbol\nin preference to man. These ancient and universal tales are all of\nanimals; as the latest discoveries in the oldest pre-historic caverns\nare all of animals. Man, in his simpler states, always felt that he\nhimself was something too mysterious to be drawn. But the legend he\ncarved under these cruder symbols was everywhere the same; and whether\nfables began with Æsop or began with Adam, whether they were German\nand mediæval as Reynard the Fox, or as French and Renaissance as\nLa Fontaine, the upshot is everywhere essentially the same: that\nsuperiority is always insolent, because it is always accidental; that\npride goes before a fall; and that there is such a thing as being too\nclever by half. You will not find any other legend but this written\nupon the rocks by any hand of man. There is every type and time of\nfable: but there is only one moral to the fable; because there is only\none moral to everything_.\n\nG. K.

that\nwas trained along a high trellis, and did his best to reach them by\njumping as high as he could into the air. But it was all in vain, for\nthey were just out of reach: so he gave up trying, and walked away\nwith an air of dignity and unconcern, remarking, \"I thought those\nGrapes were ripe, but I see now they are quite sour.\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE GOOSE THAT LAID THE GOLDEN EGGS\n\n\nA Man and his Wife had the good fortune to possess a Goose which laid\na Golden Egg every day. Lucky though they were, they soon began to\nthink they were not getting rich fast enough, and, imagining the bird\nmust be made of gold inside, they decided to kill it in order to\nsecure the whole store of precious metal at once. But when they cut it\nopen they found it was just like any other goose. Thus, they neither\ngot rich all at once, as they had hoped, nor enjoyed any longer the\ndaily addition to their wealth.\n\n    Much wants more and loses all.\n\n\n\n\nTHE CAT AND THE MICE\n\n\nThere was once a house that was overrun with Mice. A Cat heard of\nthis, and said to herself, \"That's the place for me,\" and off she went\nand took up her quarters in the house, and caught the Mice one by one\nand ate them. At last the Mice could stand it no longer, and they\ndetermined to take to their holes and stay there. \"That's awkward,\"\nsaid the Cat to herself: \"the only thing to do is to coax them out by\na trick.\" So she considered a while, and then climbed up the wall and\nlet herself hang down by her hind legs from a peg, and pretended to\nbe dead. By and by a Mouse peeped out and saw the Cat hanging there.\n\"Aha!\" it cried, \"you're very clever, madam, no doubt: but you may\nturn yourself into a bag of meal hanging there, if you like, yet you\nwon't catch us coming anywhere near you.\"\n\n    If you are wise you won't be deceived by the innocent airs of\n    those whom you have once found to be dangerous.\n\n\n\n\nTHE MISCHIEVOUS DOG\n\n\nThere was once a Dog who used to snap at people and bite them without\nany provocation, and who was a great nuisance to every one who came to\nhis master's house. So his master fastened a bell round his neck to\nwarn people of his presence. The Dog was very proud of the bell, and\nstrutted about tinkling it with immense satisfaction. But an old dog\ncame up to him and said, \"The fewer airs you give yourself the better,\nmy friend. You don't think, do you, that your bell was given you as a\nreward of merit? On the contrary, it is a badge of disgrace.\"\n\n    Notoriety is often mistaken for fame.\n\n\n\n\nTHE CHARCOAL-BURNER AND THE FULLER\n\n\nThere was once a Charcoal-burner who lived and worked by himself.\nA Fuller, however, happened to come and settle in the same\nneighbourhood; and the Charcoal-burner, having made his acquaintance\nand finding he was an agreeable sort of fellow, asked him if he would\ncome and share his house: \"We shall get to know one another better\nthat way,\" he said, \"and, beside, our household expenses will be\ndiminished.\" The Fuller thanked him, but replied, \"I couldn't think\nof it, sir: why, everything I take such pains to whiten would be\nblackened in no time by your charcoal.\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE MICE IN COUNCIL\n\n\nOnce upon a time all the Mice met together in Council, and discussed\nthe best means of securing themselves against the attacks of the cat.\nAfter several suggestions had been debated, a Mouse of some standing\nand experience got up and said, \"I think I have hit upon a plan which\nwill ensure our safety in the future, provided you approve and carry\nit out. It is that we should fasten a bell round the neck of our enemy\nthe cat, which will by its tinkling warn us of her approach.\" This\nproposal was warmly applauded, and it had been already decided to\nadopt it, when an old Mouse got upon his feet and said, \"I agree with\nyou all that the plan before us is an admirable one: but may I ask who\nis going to bell the cat?\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE BAT AND THE WEASELS\n\n\nA Bat fell to the ground and was caught by a Weasel, and was just\ngoing to be killed and eaten when it begged to be let go. The Weasel\nsaid he couldn't do that because he was an enemy of all birds on\nprinciple. \"Oh, but,\" said the Bat, \"I'm not a bird at all: I'm a\nmouse.\" \"So you are,\" said the Weasel, \"now I come to look at you\";\nand he let it go. Some time after this the Bat was caught in just the\nsame way by another Weasel, and, as before, begged for its life. \"No,\"\nsaid the Weasel, \"I never let a mouse go by any chance.\" \"But I'm not\na mouse,\" said the Bat; \"I'm a bird.\" \"Why, so you are,\" said the\nWeasel; and he too let the Bat go.\n\n    Look and see which way the wind blows before you commit yourself.\n\n\n\n\nTHE DOG AND THE SOW\n\n\nA Dog and a Sow were arguing and each claimed that its own young ones\nwere finer than those of any other animal. \"Well,\" said the Sow at\nlast, \"mine can see, at any rate, when they come into the world: but\nyours are born blind.\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE FOX AND THE CROW\n\n\nA Crow was sitting on a branch of a tree with a piece of cheese in her\nbeak when a Fox observed her and set his wits to work to discover\nsome way of getting the cheese. Coming and standing under the tree he\nlooked up and said, \"What a noble bird I see above me! Her beauty is\nwithout equal, the hue of her plumage exquisite. If only her voice is\nas sweet as her looks are fair, she ought without doubt to be Queen of\nthe Birds.\" The Crow was hugely flattered by this, and just to show\nthe Fox that she could sing she gave a loud caw. Down came the cheese,\nof course, and the Fox, snatching it up, said, \"You have a voice,\nmadam, I see: what you want is wits.\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE HORSE AND THE GROOM\n\n\nThere was once a Groom who used to spend long hours clipping and\ncombing the Horse of which he had charge, but who daily stole a\nportion of his allowance of oats, and sold it for his own profit. The\nHorse gradually got into worse and worse condition, and at last cried\nto the Groom, \"If you really want me to look sleek and well, you must\ncomb me less and feed me more.\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE WOLF AND THE LAMB\n\n\nA Wolf came upon a Lamb straying from the flock, and felt some\ncompunction about taking the life of so helpless a creature without\nsome plausible excuse; so he cast about for a grievance and said\nat last, \"Last year, sirrah, you grossly insulted me.\" \"That is\nimpossible, sir,\" bleated the Lamb, \"for I wasn't born then.\" \"Well,\"\nretorted the Wolf, \"you feed in my pastures.\" \"That cannot be,\"\nreplied the Lamb, \"for I have never yet tasted grass.\" \"You drink from\nmy spring, then,\" continued the Wolf. \"Indeed, sir,\" said the poor\nLamb, \"I have never yet drunk anything but my mother's milk.\" \"Well,\nanyhow,\" said the Wolf, \"I'm not going without my dinner\": and he\nsprang upon the Lamb and devoured it without more ado.\n\n\n\n\nTHE PEACOCK AND THE CRANE\n\n\nA Peacock taunted a Crane with the dullness of her plumage. \"Look at\nmy brilliant colours,\" said she, \"and see how much finer they are than\nyour poor feathers.\" \"I am not denying,\" replied the Crane, \"that\nyours are far gayer than mine; but when it comes to flying I can\nsoar into the clouds, whereas you are confined to the earth like any\ndunghill cock.\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE CAT AND THE BIRDS\n\n\nA Cat heard that the Birds in an aviary were ailing. So he got himself\nup as a doctor, and, taking with him a set of the instruments proper\nto his profession, presented himself at the door, and inquired after\nthe health of the Birds. \"We shall do very well,\" they replied,\nwithout letting him in, \"when we've seen the last of you.\"\n\n    A villain may disguise himself, but he will not deceive the wise.\n\n\n\n\nTHE SPENDTHRIFT AND THE SWALLOW\n\n\nA Spendthrift, who had wasted his fortune, and had nothing left but\nthe clothes in which he stood, saw a Swallow one fine day in early\nspring. Thinking that summer had come, and that he could now do\nwithout his coat, he went and sold it for what it would fetch. A\nchange, however, took place in the weather, and there came a sharp\nfrost which killed the unfortunate Swallow. When the Spendthrift saw\nits dead body he cried, \"Miserable bird! Thanks to you I am perishing\nof cold myself.\"\n\n    One swallow does not make summer.\n\n\n\n\nTHE OLD WOMAN AND THE DOCTOR\n\n\nAn Old Woman became almost totally blind from a disease of the eyes,\nand, after consulting a Doctor, made an agreement with him in the\npresence of witnesses that she should pay him a high fee if he\ncured her, while if he failed he was to receive nothing. The Doctor\naccordingly prescribed a course of treatment, and every time he paid\nher a visit he took away with him some article out of the house, until\nat last, when he visited her for the last time, and the cure was\ncomplete, there was nothing left. When the Old Woman saw that the\nhouse was empty she refused to pay him his fee; and, after repeated\nrefusals on her part, he sued her before the magistrates for payment\nof her debt. On being brought into court she was ready with her\ndefence. \"The claimant,\" said she, \"has stated the facts about our\nagreement correctly. I undertook to pay him a fee if he cured me, and\nhe, on his part, promised to charge nothing if he failed. Now, he says\nI am cured; but I say that I am blinder than ever, and I can prove\nwhat I say. When my eyes were bad I could at any rate see well enough\nto be aware that my house contained a certain amount of furniture and\nother things; but now, when according to him I am cured, I am entirely\nunable to see anything there at all.\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE MOON AND HER MOTHER\n\n\nThe Moon once begged her Mother to make her a gown. \"How can I?\"\nreplied she; \"there's no fitting your figure. At one time you're a New\nMoon, and at another you're a Full Moon; and between whiles you're\nneither one nor the other.\"\n\n\n\n\nMERCURY AND THE WOODMAN\n\n\nA Woodman was felling a tree on the bank of a river, when his axe,\nglancing off the trunk, flew out of his hands and fell into the water.\nAs he stood by the water's edge lamenting his loss, Mercury appeared\nand asked him the reason for his grief; and on learning what had\nhappened, out of pity for his distress he dived into the river and,\nbringing up a golden axe, asked him if that was the one he had lost.\nThe Woodman replied that it was not, and Mercury then dived a second\ntime, and, bringing up a silver axe, asked if that was his. \"No, that\nis not mine either,\" said the Woodman. Once more Mercury dived into\nthe river, and brought up the missing axe. The Woodman was overjoyed\nat recovering his property, and thanked his benefactor warmly; and the\nlatter was so pleased with his honesty that he made him a present of\nthe other two axes. When the Woodman told the story to his companions,\none of these was filled with envy of his good fortune and determined\nto try his luck for himself. So he went and began to fell a tree at\nthe edge of the river, and presently contrived to let his axe drop\ninto the water. Mercury appeared as before, and, on learning that his\naxe had fallen in, he dived and brought up a golden axe, as he had\ndone on the previous occasion. Without waiting to be asked whether\nit was his or not the fellow cried, \"That's mine, that's mine,\" and\nstretched out his hand eagerly for the prize: but Mercury was so\ndisgusted at his dishonesty that he not only declined to give him the\ngolden axe, but also refused to recover for him the one he had let\nfall into the stream.\n\n    Honesty is the best policy.\n\n\n\n\nTHE ASS, THE FOX, AND THE LION\n\n\nAn Ass and a Fox went into partnership and sallied out to forage for\nfood together. They hadn't gone far before they saw a Lion coming\ntheir way, at which they were both dreadfully frightened. But the Fox\nthought he saw a way of saving his own skin, and went boldly up to the\nLion and whispered in his ear, \"I'll manage that you shall get hold of\nthe Ass without the trouble of stalking him, if you'll promise to let\nme go free.\" The Lion agreed to this, and the Fox then rejoined his\ncompanion and contrived before long to lead him by a hidden pit, which\nsome hunter had dug as a trap for wild animals, and into which he\nfell. When the Lion saw that the Ass was safely caught and couldn't\nget away, it was to the Fox that he first turned his attention, and he\nsoon finished him off, and then at his leisure proceeded to feast upon\nthe Ass.\n\n    Betray a friend, and you'll often find you have ruined yourself.\n\n\n\n\nTHE LION AND THE MOUSE\n\n\nA Lion asleep in his lair was waked up by a Mouse running over his\nface. Losing his temper he seized it with his paw and was about to\nkill it. The Mouse, terrified, piteously entreated him to spare its\nlife. \"Please let me go,\" it cried, \"and one day I will repay you for\nyour kindness.\" The idea of so insignificant a creature ever being\nable to do anything for him amused the Lion so much that he laughed\naloud, and good-humouredly let it go. But the Mouse's chance came,\nafter all. One day the Lion got entangled in a net which had been\nspread for game by some hunters, and the Mouse heard and recognised\nhis roars of anger and ran to the spot. Without more ado it set to\nwork to gnaw the ropes with its teeth, and succeeded before long in\nsetting the Lion free. \"There!\" said the Mouse, \"you laughed at me\nwhen I promised I would repay you: but now you see, even a Mouse can\nhelp a Lion.\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE CROW AND THE PITCHER\n\n\nA thirsty Crow found a Pitcher with some water in it, but so little\nwas there that, try as she might, she could not reach it with her\nbeak, and it seemed as though she would die of thirst within sight of\nthe remedy. At last she hit upon a clever plan. She began dropping\npebbles into the Pitcher, and with each pebble the water rose a little\nhigher until at last it reached the brim, and the knowing bird was\nenabled to quench her thirst.\n\n    Necessity is the mother of invention.\n\n\n\n\nTHE BOYS AND THE FROGS\n\n\nSome mischievous Boys were playing on the edge of a pond, and,\ncatching sight of some Frogs swimming about in the shallow water, they\nbegan to amuse themselves by pelting them with stones, and they killed\nseveral of them. At last one of the Frogs put his head out of the\nwater and said, \"Oh, stop! stop! I beg of you: what is sport to you is\ndeath to us.\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE NORTH WIND AND THE SUN\n\n\nA dispute arose between the North Wind and the Sun, each claiming\nthat he was stronger than the other. At last they agreed to try their\npowers upon a traveller, to see which could soonest strip him of his\ncloak. The North Wind had the first try; and, gathering up all his\nforce for the attack, he came whirling furiously down upon the man,\nand caught up his cloak as though he would wrest it from him by one\nsingle effort: but the harder he blew, the more closely the man\nwrapped it round himself. Then came the turn of the Sun. At first he\nbeamed gently upon the traveller, who soon unclasped his cloak and\nwalked on with it hanging loosely about his shoulders: then he shone\nforth in his full strength, and the man, before he had gone many\nsteps, was glad to throw his cloak right off and complete his journey\nmore lightly clad.\n\n    Persuasion is better than force\n\n\n\n\nTHE MISTRESS AND HER SERVANTS\n\n\nA Widow, thrifty and industrious, had two servants, whom she kept\npretty hard at work. They were not allowed to lie long abed in the\nmornings, but the old lady had them up and doing as soon as the cock\ncrew. They disliked intensely having to get up at such an hour,\nespecially in winter-time: and they thought that if it were not for\nthe cock waking up their Mistress so horribly early, they could\nsleep longer. So they caught it and wrung its neck. But they weren't\nprepared for the consequences. For what happened was that their\nMistress, not hearing the cock crow as usual, waked them up earlier\nthan ever, and set them to work in the middle of the night.\n\n\n\n\nTHE GOODS AND THE ILLS\n\n\nThere was a time in the youth of the world when Goods and Ills entered\nequally into the concerns of men, so that the Goods did not prevail\nto make them altogether blessed, nor the Ills to make them wholly\nmiserable. But owing to the foolishness of mankind the Ills multiplied\ngreatly in number and increased in strength, until it seemed as though\nthey would deprive the Goods of all share in human affairs, and banish\nthem from the earth. The latter, therefore, betook themselves to\nheaven and complained to Jupiter of the treatment they had received,\nat the same time praying him to grant them protection from the Ills,\nand to advise them concerning the manner of their intercourse with\nmen. Jupiter granted their request for protection, and decreed that\nfor the future they should not go among men openly in a body, and so\nbe liable to attack from the hostile Ills, but singly and unobserved,\nand at infrequent and unexpected intervals. Hence it is that the earth\nis full of Ills, for they come and go as they please and are never far\naway; while Goods, alas! come one by one only, and have to travel all\nthe way from heaven, so that they are very seldom seen.\n\n\n\n\nTHE HARES AND THE FROGS\n\n\nThe Hares once gathered together and lamented the unhappiness of their\nlot, exposed as they were to dangers on all sides and lacking the\nstrength and the courage to hold their own. Men, dogs, birds and\nbeasts of prey were all their enemies, and killed and devoured them\ndaily: and sooner than endure such persecution any longer, they one\nand all determined to end their miserable lives. Thus resolved\nand desperate, they rushed in a body towards a neighbouring pool,\nintending to drown themselves. On the bank were sitting a number of\nFrogs, who, when they heard the noise of the Hares as they ran, with\none accord leaped into the water and hid themselves in the depths.\nThen one of the older Hares who was wiser than the rest cried out to\nhis companions, \"Stop, my friends, take heart; don't let us destroy\nourselves after all: see, here are creatures who are afraid of us, and\nwho must, therefore, be still more timid than ourselves.\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE FOX AND THE STORK\n\n\nA Fox invited a Stork to dinner, at which the only fare provided was a\nlarge flat dish of soup. The Fox lapped it up with great relish, but\nthe Stork with her long bill tried in vain to partake of the savoury\nbroth. Her evident distress caused the sly Fox much amusement. But not\nlong after the Stork invited him in turn, and set before him a pitcher\nwith a long and narrow neck, into which she could get her bill with\nease. Thus, while she enjoyed her dinner, the Fox sat by hungry and\nhelpless, for it was impossible for him to reach the tempting contents\nof the vessel.\n\n\n\n\nTHE WOLF IN SHEEP'S CLOTHING\n\n\nA Wolf resolved to disguise himself in order that he might prey upon a\nflock of sheep without fear of detection. So he clothed himself in a\nsheepskin, and slipped among the sheep when they were out at pasture.\nHe completely deceived the shepherd, and when the flock was penned\nfor the night he was shut in with the rest. But that very night as it\nhappened, the shepherd, requiring a supply of mutton for the table,\nlaid hands on the Wolf in mistake for a Sheep, and killed him with his\nknife on the spot.\n\n\n\n\nTHE STAG IN THE OX-STALL\n\n\nA Stag, chased from his lair by the hounds, took refuge in a farmyard,\nand, entering a stable where a number of oxen were stalled, thrust\nhimself under a pile of hay in a vacant stall, where he lay concealed,\nall but the tips of his horns. Presently one of the Oxen said to him,\n\"What has induced you to come in here? Aren't you aware of the risk\nyou are running of being captured by the herdsmen?\" To which he\nreplied, \"Pray let me stay for the present. When night comes I shall\neasily escape under cover of the dark.\" In the course of the afternoon\nmore than one of the farm-hands came in, to attend to the wants of\nthe cattle, but not one of them noticed the presence of the Stag, who\naccordingly began to congratulate himself on his escape and to express\nhis gratitude to the Oxen. \"We wish you well,\" said the one who had\nspoken before, \"but you are not out of danger yet. If the master\ncomes, you will certainly be found out, for nothing ever escapes his\nkeen eyes.\" Presently, sure enough, in he came, and made a great to-do\nabout the way the Oxen were kept. \"The beasts are starving,\" he cried;\n\"here, give them more hay, and put plenty of litter under them.\" As he\nspoke, he seized an armful himself from the pile where the Stag lay\nconcealed, and at once detected him. Calling his men, he had him\nseized at once and killed for the table.\n\n\n\n\nTHE MILKMAID AND HER PAIL\n\n\nA farmer's daughter had been out to milk the cows, and was returning\nto the dairy carrying her pail of milk upon her head. As she walked\nalong, she fell a-musing after this fashion: \"The milk in this pail\nwill provide me with cream, which I will make into butter and take to\nmarket to sell. With the money I will buy a number of eggs, and these,\nwhen hatched, will produce chickens, and by and by I shall have quite\na large poultry-yard. Then I shall sell some of my fowls, and with the\nmoney which they will bring in I will buy myself a new gown, which\nI shall wear when I go to the fair; and all the young fellows will\nadmire it, and come and make love to me, but I shall toss my head\nand have nothing to say to them.\" Forgetting all about the pail, and\nsuiting the action to the word, she tossed her head. Down went the\npail, all the milk was spilled, and all her fine castles in the air\nvanished in a moment!\n\n    Do not count your chickens before they are hatched.\n\n\n\n\nTHE DOLPHINS, THE WHALES, AND THE SPRAT\n\n\nThe Dolphins quarrelled with the Whales, and before very long they\nbegan fighting with one another. The battle was very fierce, and had\nlasted some time without any sign of coming to an end, when a Sprat\nthought that perhaps he could stop it; so he stepped in and tried to\npersuade them to give up fighting and make friends. But one of the\nDolphins said to him contemptuously, \"We would rather go on fighting\ntill we're all killed than be reconciled by a Sprat like you!\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE FOX AND THE MONKEY\n\n\nA Fox and a Monkey were on the road together, and fell into a dispute\nas to which of the two was the better born. They kept it up for some\ntime, till they came to a place where the road passed through a\ncemetery full of monuments, when the Monkey stopped and looked about\nhim and gave a great sigh. \"Why do you sigh?\" said the Fox. The Monkey\npointed to the tombs and replied, \"All the monuments that you see here\nwere put up in honour of my forefathers, who in their day were eminent\nmen.\" The Fox was speechless for a moment, but quickly recovering he\nsaid, \"Oh! don't stop at any lie, sir; you're quite safe: I'm sure\nnone of your ancestors will rise up and expose you.\"\n\n    Boasters brag most when they cannot be detected.\n\n\n\n\nTHE ASS AND THE LAP-DOG\n\n\nThere was once a man who had an Ass and a Lap-dog. The Ass was housed\nin the stable with plenty of oats and hay to eat and was as well off\nas an ass could be. The little Dog was made a great pet of by his\nmaster, who fondled him and often let him lie in his lap; and if he\nwent out to dinner, he would bring back a tit-bit or two to give him\nwhen he ran to meet him on his return. The Ass had, it is true, a good\ndeal of work to do, carting or grinding the corn, or carrying the\nburdens of the farm: and ere long he became very jealous, contrasting\nhis own life of labour with the ease and idleness of the Lap-dog. At\nlast one day he broke his halter, and frisking into the house just as\nhis master sat down to dinner, he pranced and capered about, mimicking\nthe frolics of the little favourite, upsetting the table and smashing\nthe crockery with his clumsy efforts. Not content with that, he even\ntried to jump on his master's lap, as he had so often seen the dog\nallowed to do. At that the servants, seeing the danger their master\nwas in, belaboured the silly Ass with sticks and cudgels, and drove\nhim back to his stable half dead with his beating. \"Alas!\" he cried,\n\"all this I have brought on myself. Why could I not be satisfied with\nmy natural and honourable position, without wishing to imitate the\nridiculous antics of that useless little Lap-dog?\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE FIR-TREE AND THE BRAMBLE\n\n\nA Fir-tree was boasting to a Bramble, and said, somewhat\ncontemptuously, \"You poor creature, you are of no use whatever. Now,\nlook at me: I am useful for all sorts of things, particularly when men\nbuild houses; they can't do without me then.\" But the Bramble replied,\n\"Ah, that's all very well: but you wait till they come with axes and\nsaws to cut you down, and then you'll wish you were a Bramble and not\na Fir.\"\n\n    Better poverty without a care than wealth with its many\n    obligations.\n\n\n\n\nTHE FROGS' COMPLAINT AGAINST THE SUN\n\n\nOnce upon a time the Sun was about to take to himself a wife. The\nFrogs in terror all raised their voices to the skies, and Jupiter,\ndisturbed by the noise, asked them what they were croaking about. They\nreplied, \"The Sun is bad enough even while he is single, drying up our\nmarshes with his heat as he does. But what will become of us if he\nmarries and begets other Suns?\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE DOG, THE COCK, AND THE FOX\n\n\nA Dog and a Cock became great friends, and agreed to travel together.\nAt nightfall the Cock flew up into the branches of a tree to roost,\nwhile the Dog curled himself up inside the trunk, which was hollow. At\nbreak of day the Cock woke up and crew, as usual. A Fox heard, and,\nwishing to make a breakfast of him, came and stood under the tree and\nbegged him to come down. \"I should so like,\" said he, \"to make the\nacquaintance of one who has such a beautiful voice.\" The Cock replied,\n\"Would you just wake my porter who sleeps at the foot of the tree?\nHe'll open the door and let you in.\" The Fox accordingly rapped on the\ntrunk, when out rushed the Dog and tore him in pieces.\n\n\n\n\nTHE GNAT AND THE BULL\n\n\nA Gnat alighted on one of the horns of a Bull, and remained sitting\nthere for a considerable time. When it had rested sufficiently and was\nabout to fly away, it said to the Bull, \"Do you mind if I go now?\" The\nBull merely raised his eyes and remarked, without interest, \"It's all\none to me; I didn't notice when you came, and I shan't know when you\ngo away.\"\n\n    We may often be of more consequence in our own eyes than in the\n    eyes of our neighbours.\n\n\n\n\nTHE BEAR AND THE TRAVELLERS\n\n\nTwo Travellers were on the road together, when a Bear suddenly\nappeared on the scene. Before he observed them, one made for a tree at\nthe side of the road, and climbed up into the branches and hid there.\nThe other was not so nimble as his companion; and, as he could not\nescape, he threw himself on the ground and pretended to be dead. The\nBear came up and sniffed all round him, but he kept perfectly still\nand held his breath: for they say that a bear will not touch a dead\nbody. The Bear took him for a corpse, and went away. When the coast\nwas clear, the Traveller in the tree came down, and asked the other\nwhat it was the Bear had whispered to him when he put his mouth to\nhis ear. The other replied, \"He told me never again to travel with a\nfriend who deserts you at the first sign of danger.\"\n\n    Misfortune tests the sincerity of friendship.\n\n\n\n\nTHE SLAVE AND THE LION\n\n\nA Slave ran away from his master, by whom he had been most cruelly\ntreated, and, in order to avoid capture, betook himself into the\ndesert. As he wandered about in search of food and shelter, he came to\na cave, which he entered and found to be unoccupied. Really, however,\nit was a Lion's den, and almost immediately, to the horror of the\nwretched fugitive, the Lion himself appeared. The man gave himself\nup for lost: but, to his utter astonishment, the Lion, instead of\nspringing upon him and devouring him, came and fawned upon him, at\nthe same time whining and lifting up his paw. Observing it to be much\nswollen and inflamed, he examined it and found a large thorn embedded\nin the ball of the foot. He accordingly removed it and dressed\nthe wound as well as he could: and in course of time it healed up\ncompletely. The Lion's gratitude was unbounded; he looked upon the man\nas his friend, and they shared the cave for some time together. A day\ncame, however, when the Slave began to long for the society of his\nfellow-men, and he bade farewell to the Lion and returned to the town.\nHere he was presently recognised and carried off in chains to his\nformer master, who resolved to make an example of him, and ordered\nthat he should be thrown to the beasts at the next public spectacle in\nthe theatre. On the fatal day the beasts were loosed into the arena,\nand among the rest a Lion of huge bulk and ferocious aspect; and then\nthe wretched Slave was cast in among them. What was the amazement of\nthe spectators, when the Lion after one glance bounded up to him and\nlay down at his feet with every expression of affection and delight!\nIt was his old friend of the cave! The audience clamoured that\nthe Slave's life should be spared: and the governor of the town,\nmarvelling at such gratitude and fidelity in a beast, decreed that\nboth should receive their liberty.\n\n\n\n\nTHE FLEA AND THE MAN\n\n\nA Flea bit a Man, and bit him again, and again, till he could stand it\nno longer, but made a thorough search for it, and at last succeeded\nin catching it. Holding it between his finger and thumb, he said--or\nrather shouted, so angry was he--\"Who are you, pray, you wretched\nlittle creature, that you make so free with my person?\" The Flea,\nterrified, whimpered in a weak little voice, \"Oh, sir! pray let me\ngo; don't kill me! I am such a little thing that I can't do you much\nharm.\" But the Man laughed and said, \"I am going to kill you now, at\nonce: whatever is bad has got to be destroyed, no matter how slight\nthe harm it does.\"\n\n    Do not waste your pity on a scamp.\n\n\n\n\nTHE BEE AND JUPITER\n\n\nA Queen Bee from Hymettus flew up to Olympus with some fresh honey\nfrom the hive as a present to Jupiter, who was so pleased with the\ngift that he promised to give her anything she liked to ask for. She\nsaid she would be very grateful if he would give stings to the bees,\nto kill people who robbed them of their honey. Jupiter was greatly\ndispleased with this request, for he loved mankind: but he had given\nhis word, so he said that stings they should have. The stings he gave\nthem, however, were of such a kind that whenever a bee stings a man\nthe sting is left in the wound and the bee dies.\n\n    Evil wishes, like fowls, come home to roost.\n\n\n\n\nTHE OAK AND THE REEDS\n\n\nAn Oak that grew on the bank of a river was uprooted by a severe\ngale of wind, and thrown across the stream. It fell among some Reeds\ngrowing by the water, and said to them, \"How is it that you, who are\nso frail and slender, have managed to weather the storm, whereas I,\nwith all my strength, have been torn up by the roots and hurled into\nthe river?\" \"You were stubborn,\" came the reply, \"and fought against\nthe storm, which proved stronger than you: but we bow and yield to\nevery breeze, and thus the gale passed harmlessly over our heads.\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE BLIND MAN AND THE CUB\n\n\nThere was once a Blind Man who had so fine a sense of touch that, when\nany animal was put into his hands, he could tell what it was merely by\nthe feel of it. One day the Cub of a Wolf was put into his hands, and\nhe was asked what it was. He felt it for some time, and then said,\n\"Indeed, I am not sure whether it is a Wolf's Cub or a Fox's: but this\nI know--it would never do to trust it in a sheepfold.\"\n\n    Evil tendencies are early shown.\n\n\n\n\nTHE BOY AND THE SNAILS\n\n\nA Farmer's Boy went looking for Snails, and, when he had picked up\nboth his hands full, he set about making a fire at which to roast\nthem; for he meant to eat them. When it got well alight and the Snails\nbegan to feel the heat, they gradually withdrew more and more into\ntheir shells with the hissing noise they always make when they do so.\nWhen the Boy heard it, he said, \"You abandoned creatures, how can you\nfind heart to whistle when your houses are burning?\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE APES AND THE TWO TRAVELLERS\n\n\nTwo men were travelling together, one of whom never spoke the truth,\nwhereas the other never told a lie: and they came in the course of\ntheir travels to the land of Apes. The King of the Apes, hearing of\ntheir arrival, ordered them to be brought before him; and by way of\nimpressing them with his magnificence, he received them sitting on\na throne, while the Apes, his subjects, were ranged in long rows on\neither side of him. When the Travellers came into his presence he\nasked them what they thought of him as a King. The lying Traveller\nsaid, \"Sire, every one must see that you are a most noble and mighty\nmonarch.\" \"And what do you think of my subjects?\" continued the King.\n\"They,\" said the Traveller, \"are in every way worthy of their royal\nmaster.\" The Ape was so delighted with his answer that he gave him\na very handsome present. The other Traveller thought that if his\ncompanion was rewarded so splendidly for telling a lie, he himself\nwould certainly receive a still greater reward for telling the truth;\nso, when the Ape turned to him and said, \"And what, sir, is your\nopinion?\" he replied, \"I think you are a very fine Ape, and all your\nsubjects are fine Apes too.\" The King of the Apes was so enraged at\nhis reply that he ordered him to be taken away and clawed to death.\n\n\n\n\nTHE ASS AND HIS BURDENS\n\n\nA Pedlar who owned an Ass one day bought a quantity of salt, and\nloaded up his beast with as much as he could bear. On the way home the\nAss stumbled as he was crossing a stream and fell into the water. The\nsalt got thoroughly wetted and much of it melted and drained away, so\nthat, when he got on his legs again, the Ass found his load had become\nmuch less heavy. His master, however, drove him back to town and\nbought more salt, which he added to what remained in the panniers, and\nstarted out again. No sooner had they reached a stream than the Ass\nlay down in it, and rose, as before, with a much lighter load. But his\nmaster detected the trick, and turning back once more, bought a large\nnumber of sponges, and piled them on the back of the Ass. When they\ncame to the stream the Ass again lay down: but this time, as the\nsponges soaked up large quantities of water, he found, when he got up\non his legs, that he had a bigger burden to carry than ever.\n\n    You may play a good card once too often.\n\n\n\n\nTHE SHEPHERD'S BOY AND THE WOLF\n\n\nA Shepherd's Boy was tending his flock near a village, and thought it\nwould be great fun to hoax the villagers by pretending that a Wolf was\nattacking the sheep: so he shouted out, \"Wolf! wolf!\" and when the\npeople came running up he laughed at them for their pains. He did\nthis more than once, and every time the villagers found they had been\nhoaxed, for there was no Wolf at all. At last a Wolf really did come,\nand the Boy cried, \"Wolf! wolf!\" as loud as he could: but the people\nwere so used to hearing him call that they took no notice of his cries\nfor help. And so the Wolf had it all his own way, and killed off sheep\nafter sheep at his leisure.\n\n    You cannot believe a liar even when he tells the truth.\n\n\n\n\nTHE FOX AND THE GOAT\n\n\nA Fox fell into a well and was unable to get out again. By and by a\nthirsty Goat came by, and seeing the Fox in the well asked him if the\nwater was good. \"Good?\" said the Fox, \"it's the best water I ever\ntasted in all my life. Come down and try it yourself.\" The Goat\nthought of nothing but the prospect of quenching his thirst, and\njumped in at once. When he had had enough to drink, he looked about,\nlike the Fox, for some way of getting out, but could find none.\nPresently the Fox said, \"I have an idea. You stand on your hind legs,\nand plant your forelegs firmly against the side of the well, and then\nI'll climb on to your back, and, from there, by stepping on your\nhorns, I can get out. And when I'm out, I'll help you out too.\" The\nGoat did as he was requested, and the Fox climbed on to his back and\nso out of the well; and then he coolly walked away. The Goat called\nloudly after him and reminded him of his promise to help him out: but\nthe Fox merely turned and said, \"If you had as much sense in your head\nas you have hair in your beard you wouldn't have got into the well\nwithout making certain that you could get out again.\"\n\n    Look before your leap.\n\n\n\n\nTHE FISHERMAN AND THE SPRAT\n\n\nA Fisherman cast his net into the sea, and when he drew it up again it\ncontained nothing but a single Sprat that begged to be put back into\nthe water. \"I'm only a little fish now,\" it said, \"but I shall grow\nbig one day, and then if you come and catch me again I shall be of\nsome use to you.\" But the Fisherman replied, \"Oh, no, I shall keep you\nnow I've got you: if I put you back, should I ever see you again? Not\nlikely!\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE BOASTING TRAVELLER\n\n\nA Man once went abroad on his travels, and when he came home he\nhad wonderful tales to tell of the things he had done in foreign\ncountries. Among other things, he said he had taken part in a\njumping-match at Rhodes, and had done a wonderful jump which no one\ncould beat. \"Just go to Rhodes and ask them,\" he said; \"every one will\ntell you it's true.\" But one of those who were listening said, \"If you\ncan jump as well as all that, we needn't go to Rhodes to prove it.\nLet's just imagine this is Rhodes for a minute: and now--jump!\"\n\n    Deeds, not words.\n\n\n\n\nTHE CRAB AND HIS MOTHER\n\n\nAn Old Crab said to her son, \"Why do you walk sideways like that, my\nson? You ought to walk straight.\" The Young Crab replied, \"Show me\nhow, dear mother, and I'll follow your example.\" The Old Crab tried,\nbut tried in vain, and then saw how foolish she had been to find fault\nwith her child.\n\n    Example is better than precept.\n\n\n\n\nTHE ASS AND HIS SHADOW\n\n\nA certain man hired an Ass for a journey in summertime, and started\nout with the owner following behind to drive the beast. By and by, in\nthe heat of the day, they stopped to rest, and the traveller wanted to\nlie down in the Ass's Shadow; but the owner, who himself wished to be\nout of the sun, wouldn't let him do that; for he said he had hired the\nAss only, and not his Shadow: the other maintained that his bargain\nsecured him complete control of the Ass for the time being. From words\nthey came to blows; and while they were belabouring each other the Ass\ntook to his heels and was soon out of sight.\n\n\n\n\nTHE FARMER AND HIS SONS\n\n\nA Farmer, being at death's door, and desiring to impart to his Sons a\nsecret of much moment, called them round him and said, \"My sons, I am\nshortly about to die; I would have you know, therefore, that in my\nvineyard there lies a hidden treasure. Dig, and you will find it.\" As\nsoon as their father was dead, the Sons took spade and fork and turned\nup the soil of the vineyard over and over again, in their search for\nthe treasure which they supposed to lie buried there. They found none,\nhowever: but the vines, after so thorough a digging, produced a crop\nsuch as had never before been seen.\n\n\n\n\nTHE DOG AND THE COOK\n\n\nA rich man once invited a number of his friends and acquaintances to\na banquet. His dog thought it would be a good opportunity to invite\nanother Dog, a friend of his; so he went to him and said, \"My master\nis giving a feast: there'll be a fine spread, so come and dine with me\nto-night.\" The Dog thus invited came, and when he saw the preparations\nbeing made in the kitchen he said to himself, \"My word, I'm in luck:\nI'll take care to eat enough to-night to last me two or three days.\"\nAt the same time he wagged his tail briskly, by way of showing his\nfriend how delighted he was to have been asked. But just then the Cook\ncaught sight of him, and, in his annoyance at seeing a strange Dog in\nthe kitchen, caught him up by the hind legs and threw him out of the\nwindow. He had a nasty fall, and limped away as quickly as he could,\nhowling dismally. Presently some other dogs met him, and said, \"Well,\nwhat sort of a dinner did you get?\" To which he replied, \"I had a\nsplendid time: the wine was so good, and I drank so much of it, that I\nreally don't remember how I got out of the house!\"\n\n    Be shy of favours bestowed at the expense of others.\n\n\n\n\nTHE MONKEY AS KING\n\n\nAt a gathering of all the animals the Monkey danced and delighted them\nso much that they made him their King. The Fox, however, was very much\ndisgusted at the promotion of the Monkey: so having one day found a\ntrap with a piece of meat in it, he took the Monkey there and said to\nhim, \"Here is a dainty morsel I have found, sire; I did not take it\nmyself, because I thought it ought to be reserved for you, our King.\nWill you be pleased to accept it?\" The Monkey made at once for the\nmeat and got caught in the trap. Then he bitterly reproached the Fox\nfor leading him into danger; but the Fox only laughed and said, \"O\nMonkey, you call yourself King of the Beasts and haven't more sense\nthan to be taken in like that!\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE THIEVES AND THE COCK\n\n\nSome Thieves broke into a house, and found nothing worth taking except\na Cock, which they seized and carried off with them. When they were\npreparing their supper, one of them caught up the Cock, and was about\nto wring his neck, when he cried out for mercy and said, \"Pray do not\nkill me: you will find me a most useful bird, for I rouse honest men\nto their work in the morning by my crowing.\" But the Thief replied\nwith some heat, \"Yes, I know you do, making it still harder for us to\nget a livelihood. Into the pot you go!\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE FARMER AND FORTUNE\n\n\nA Farmer was ploughing one day on his farm when he turned up a pot of\ngolden coins with his plough. He was overjoyed at his discovery, and\nfrom that time forth made an offering daily at the shrine of the\nGoddess of the Earth. Fortune was displeased at this, and came to him\nand said, \"My man, why do you give Earth the credit for the gift which\nI bestowed upon you? You never thought of thanking me for your good\nluck; but should you be unlucky enough to lose what you have gained\nI know very well that I, Fortune, should then come in for all the\nblame.\"\n\n    Show gratitude where gratitude is due.\n\n\n\n\nJUPITER AND THE MONKEY\n\n\nJupiter issued a proclamation to all the beasts, and offered a\nprize to the one who, in his judgment, produced the most beautiful\noffspring. Among the rest came the Monkey, carrying a baby monkey in\nher arms, a hairless, flat-nosed little fright. When they saw it, the\ngods all burst into peal on peal of laughter; but the Monkey hugged\nher little one to her, and said, \"Jupiter may give the prize to\nwhomsoever he likes: but I shall always think my baby the most\nbeautiful of them all.\"\n\n\n\n\nFATHER AND SONS\n\n\nA certain man had several Sons who were always quarrelling with one\nanother, and, try as he might, he could not get them to live together\nin harmony. So he determined to convince them of their folly by the\nfollowing means. Bidding them fetch a bundle of sticks, he invited\neach in turn to break it across his knee. All tried and all failed:\nand then he undid the bundle, and handed them the sticks one by one,\nwhen they had no difficulty at all in breaking them. \"There, my boys,\"\nsaid he, \"united you will be more than a match for your enemies: but\nif you quarrel and separate, your weakness will put you at the mercy\nof those who attack you.\"\n\n    Union is strength.\n\n\n\n\nTHE LAMP\n\n\nA Lamp, well filled with oil, burned with a clear and steady light,\nand began to swell with pride and boast that it shone more brightly\nthan the sun himself. Just then a puff of wind came and blew it out.\nSome one struck a match and lit it again, and said, \"You just keep\nalight, and never mind the sun. Why, even the stars never need to be\nrelit as you had to be just now.\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE OWL AND THE BIRDS\n\n\nThe Owl is a very wise bird; and once, long ago, when the first oak\nsprouted in the forest, she called all the other Birds together and\nsaid to them, \"You see this tiny tree? If you take my advice, you will\ndestroy it now when it is small: for when it grows big, the mistletoe\nwill appear upon it, from which birdlime will be prepared for your\ndestruction.\" Again, when the first flax was sown, she said to them,\n\"Go and eat up that seed, for it is the seed of the flax, out of which\nmen will one day make nets to catch you.\" Once more, when she saw the\nfirst archer, she warned the Birds that he was their deadly enemy, who\nwould wing his arrows with their own feathers and shoot them. But they\ntook no notice of what she said: in fact, they thought she was rather\nmad, and laughed at her. When, however, everything turned out as she\nhad foretold, they changed their minds and conceived a great respect\nfor her wisdom. Hence, whenever she appears, the Birds attend upon\nher in the hope of hearing something that may be for their good. She,\nhowever, gives them advice no longer, but sits moping and pondering on\nthe folly of her kind.\n\n\n\n\nTHE ASS IN THE LION'S SKIN\n\n\nAn Ass found a Lion's Skin, and dressed himself up in it. Then he went\nabout frightening every one he met, for they all took him to be a\nlion, men and beasts alike, and took to their heels when they saw\nhim coming. Elated by the success of his trick, he loudly brayed in\ntriumph. The Fox heard him, and recognised him at once for the Ass he\nwas, and said to him, \"Oho, my friend, it's you, is it? I, too, should\nhave been afraid if I hadn't heard your voice.\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE SHE-GOATS AND THEIR BEARDS\n\n\nJupiter granted beards to the She-Goats at their own request, much\nto the disgust of the he-Goats, who considered this to be an\nunwarrantable invasion of their rights and dignities. So they sent a\ndeputation to him to protest against his action. He, however, advised\nthem not to raise any objections. \"What's in a tuft of hair?\" said he.\n\"Let them have it if they want it. They can never be a match for you\nin strength.\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE OLD LION\n\n\nA Lion, enfeebled by age and no longer able to procure food for\nhimself by force, determined to do so by cunning. Betaking himself to\na cave, he lay down inside and feigned to be sick: and whenever any of\nthe other animals entered to inquire after his health, he sprang upon\nthem and devoured them. Many lost their lives in this way, till one\nday a Fox called at the cave, and, having a suspicion of the truth,\naddressed the Lion from outside instead of going in, and asked him how\nhe did. He replied that he was in a very bad way: \"But,\" said he, \"why\ndo you stand outside? Pray come in.\" \"I should have done so,\" answered\nthe Fox, \"if I hadn't noticed that all the footprints point towards\nthe cave and none the other way.\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE BOY BATHING\n\n\nA Boy was bathing in a river and got out of his depth, and was in\ngreat danger of being drowned. A man who was passing along a road\nheard his cries for help, and went to the riverside and began to scold\nhim for being so careless as to get into deep water, but made no\nattempt to help him. \"Oh, sir,\" cried the Boy, \"please help me first\nand scold me afterwards.\"\n\n    Give assistance, not advice, in a crisis.\n\n\n\n\nTHE QUACK FROG\n\n\nOnce upon a time a Frog came forth from his home in the marshes and\nproclaimed to all the world that he was a learned physician, skilled\nin drugs and able to cure all diseases. Among the crowd was a Fox, who\ncalled out, \"You a doctor! Why, how can you set up to heal others when\nyou cannot even cure your own lame legs and blotched and wrinkled\nskin?\"\n\n    Physician, heal thyself.\n\n\n\n\nTHE SWOLLEN FOX\n\n\nA hungry Fox found in a hollow tree a quantity of bread and meat,\nwhich some shepherds had placed there against their return. Delighted\nwith his find he slipped in through the narrow aperture and greedily\ndevoured it all. But when he tried to get out again he found himself\nso swollen after his big meal that he could not squeeze through the\nhole, and fell to whining and groaning over his misfortune. Another\nFox, happening to pass that way, came and asked him what the matter\nwas; and, on learning the state of the case, said, \"Well, my friend, I\nsee nothing for it but for you to stay where you are till you shrink\nto your former size; you'll get out then easily enough.\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE MOUSE, THE FROG, AND THE HAWK\n\n\nA Mouse and a Frog struck up a friendship; they were not well mated,\nfor the Mouse lived entirely on land, while the Frog was equally\nat home on land or in the water. In order that they might never be\nseparated, the Frog tied himself and the Mouse together by the leg\nwith a piece of thread. As long as they kept on dry land all went\nfairly well; but, coming to the edge of a pool, the Frog jumped in,\ntaking the Mouse with him, and began swimming about and croaking with\npleasure. The unhappy Mouse, however, was soon drowned, and floated\nabout on the surface in the wake of the Frog. There he was spied by a\nHawk, who pounced down on him and seized him in his talons. The Frog\nwas unable to loose the knot which bound him to the Mouse, and thus\nwas carried off along with him and eaten by the Hawk.\n\n\n\n\nTHE BOY AND THE NETTLES\n\n\nA Boy was gathering berries from a hedge when his hand was stung by a\nNettle. Smarting with the pain, he ran to tell his mother, and said\nto her between his sobs, \"I only touched it ever so lightly, mother.\"\n\"That's just why you got stung, my son,\" she said; \"if you had grasped\nit firmly, it wouldn't have hurt you in the least.\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE PEASANT AND THE APPLE-TREE\n\n\nA Peasant had an Apple-tree growing in his garden, which bore no\nfruit, but merely served to provide a shelter from the heat for the\nsparrows and grasshoppers which sat and chirped in its branches.\nDisappointed at its barrenness he determined to cut it down, and went\nand fetched his axe for the purpose. But when the sparrows and the\ngrasshoppers saw what he was about to do, they begged him to spare\nit, and said to him, \"If you destroy the tree we shall have to seek\nshelter elsewhere, and you will no longer have our merry chirping to\nenliven your work in the garden.\" He, however, refused to listen to\nthem, and set to work with a will to cut through the trunk. A few\nstrokes showed that it was hollow inside and contained a swarm of bees\nand a large store of honey. Delighted with his find he threw down his\naxe, saying, \"The old tree is worth keeping after all.\"\n\n    Utility is most men's test of worth.\n\n\n\n\nTHE JACKDAW AND THE PIGEONS\n\n\nA Jackdaw, watching some Pigeons in a farmyard, was filled with envy\nwhen he saw how well they were fed, and determined to disguise himself\nas one of them, in order to secure a share of the good things they\nenjoyed. So he painted himself white from head to foot and joined the\nflock; and, so long as he was silent, they never suspected that he\nwas not a pigeon like themselves. But one day he was unwise enough\nto start chattering, when they at once saw through his disguise and\npecked him so unmercifully that he was glad to escape and join his own\nkind again. But the other jackdaws did not recognise him in his white\ndress, and would not let him feed with them, but drove him away: and\nso he became a homeless wanderer for his pains.\n\n\n\n\nJUPITER AND THE TORTOISE\n\n\nJupiter was about to marry a wife, and determined to celebrate the\nevent by inviting all the animals to a banquet. They all came except\nthe Tortoise, who did not put in an appearance, much to Jupiter's\nsurprise. So when he next saw the Tortoise he asked him why he had not\nbeen at the banquet. \"I don't care for going out,\" said the Tortoise;\n\"there's no place like home.\" Jupiter was so much annoyed by this\nreply that he decreed that from that time forth the Tortoise should\ncarry his house upon his back, and never be able to get away from home\neven if he wished to.\n\n\n\n\nTHE DOG IN THE MANGER\n\n\nA Dog was lying in a Manger on the hay which had been put there for\nthe cattle, and when they came and tried to eat, he growled and\nsnapped at them and wouldn't let them get at their food. \"What a\nselfish beast,\" said one of them to his companions; \"he can't eat\nhimself and yet he won't let those eat who can.\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE TWO BAGS\n\n\nEvery man carries Two Bags about with him, one in front and one\nbehind, and both are packed full of faults. The Bag in front contains\nhis neighbours' faults, the one behind his own. Hence it is that men\ndo not see their own faults, but never fail to see those of others.\n\n\n\n\nTHE OXEN AND THE AXLETREES\n\n\nA pair of Oxen were drawing a heavily loaded waggon along the highway,\nand, as they tugged and strained at the yoke, the Axletrees creaked\nand groaned terribly. This was too much for the Oxen, who turned round\nindignantly and said, \"Hullo, you there! Why do you make such a noise\nwhen we do all the work?\"\n\n    They complain most who suffer least.\n\n\n\n\nTHE BOY AND THE FILBERTS\n\n\nA Boy put his hand into a jar of Filberts, and grasped as many as his\nfist could possibly hold. But when he tried to pull it out again, he\nfound he couldn't do so, for the neck of the jar was too small to\nallow of the passage of so large a handful. Unwilling to lose his nuts\nbut unable to withdraw his hand, he burst into tears. A bystander, who\nsaw where the trouble lay, said to him, \"Come, my boy, don't be so\ngreedy: be content with half the amount, and you'll be able to get\nyour hand out without difficulty.\"\n\n    Do not attempt too much at once.\n\n\n\n\nTHE FROGS ASKING FOR A KING\n\n\nTime was when the Frogs were discontented because they had no one to\nrule over them: so they sent a deputation to Jupiter to ask him to\ngive them a King. Jupiter, despising the folly of their request, cast\na log into the pool where they lived, and said that that should be\ntheir King. The Frogs were terrified at first by the splash, and\nscuttled away into the deepest parts of the pool; but by and by, when\nthey saw that the log remained motionless, one by one they ventured to\nthe surface again, and before long, growing bolder, they began to feel\nsuch contempt for it that they even took to sitting upon it. Thinking\nthat a King of that sort was an insult to their dignity, they sent to\nJupiter a second time, and begged him to take away the sluggish King\nhe had given them, and to give them another and a better one. Jupiter,\nannoyed at being pestered in this way, sent a Stork to rule over them,\nwho no sooner arrived among them than he began to catch and eat the\nFrogs as fast as he could.\n\n\n\n\nTHE OLIVE-TREE AND THE FIG-TREE\n\n\nAn Olive-tree taunted a Fig-tree with the loss of her leaves at a\ncertain season of the year. \"You,\" she said, \"lose your leaves every\nautumn, and are bare till the spring: whereas I, as you see, remain\ngreen and flourishing all the year round.\" Soon afterwards there came\na heavy fall of snow, which settled on the leaves of the Olive so that\nshe bent and broke under the weight; but the flakes fell harmlessly\nthrough the bare branches of the Fig, which survived to bear many\nanother crop.\n\n\n\n\nTHE LION AND THE BOAR\n\n\nOne hot and thirsty day in the height of summer a Lion and a Boar came\ndown to a little spring at the same moment to drink. In a trice they\nwere quarrelling as to who should drink first. The quarrel soon became\na fight and they attacked one another with the utmost fury. Presently,\nstopping for a moment to take breath, they saw some vultures seated on\na rock above evidently waiting for one of them to be killed, when they\nwould fly down and feed upon the carcase. The sight sobered them at\nonce, and they made up their quarrel, saying, \"We had much better be\nfriends than fight and be eaten by vultures.\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE WALNUT-TREE\n\n\nA Walnut-tree, which grew by the roadside, bore every year a plentiful\ncrop of nuts. Every one who passed by pelted its branches with sticks\nand stones, in order to bring down the fruit, and the tree suffered\nseverely. \"It is hard,\" it cried, \"that the very persons who enjoy my\nfruit should thus reward me with insults and blows.\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE MAN AND THE LION\n\n\nA Man and a Lion were companions on a journey, and in the course of\nconversation they began to boast about their prowess, and each claimed\nto be superior to the other in strength and courage. They were still\narguing with some heat when they came to a cross-road where there\nwas a statue of a Man strangling a Lion. \"There!\" said the Man\ntriumphantly, \"look at that! Doesn't that prove to you that we are\nstronger than you?\" \"Not so fast, my friend,\" said the Lion: \"that is\nonly your view of the case. If we Lions could make statues, you may be\nsure that in most of them you would see the Man underneath.\"\n\n    There are two sides to every question.\n\n\n\n\nTHE TORTOISE AND THE EAGLE\n\n\nA Tortoise, discontented with his lowly life, and envious of the birds\nhe saw disporting themselves in the air, begged an Eagle to teach him\nto fly. The Eagle protested that it was idle for him to try, as nature\nhad not provided him with wings; but the Tortoise pressed him with\nentreaties and promises of treasure, insisting that it could only be\na question of learning the craft of the air. So at length the Eagle\nconsented to do the best he could for him, and picked him up in his\ntalons. Soaring with him to a great height in the sky he then let him\ngo, and the wretched Tortoise fell headlong and was dashed to pieces\non a rock.\n\n\n\n\nTHE KID ON THE HOUSETOP\n\n\nA Kid climbed up on to the roof of an outhouse, attracted by the\ngrass and other things that grew in the thatch; and as he stood there\nbrowsing away, he caught sight of a Wolf passing below, and jeered at\nhim because he couldn't reach him. The Wolf only looked up and said,\n\"I hear you, my young friend; but it is not you who mock me, but the\nroof on which you are standing.\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE FOX WITHOUT A TAIL\n\n\nA fox once fell into a trap, and after a struggle managed to get free,\nbut with the loss of his brush. He was then so much ashamed of his\nappearance that he thought life was not worth living unless he could\npersuade the other Foxes to part with their tails also, and thus\ndivert attention from his own loss. So he called a meeting of all the\nFoxes, and advised them to cut off their tails: \"They're ugly things\nanyhow,\" he said, \"and besides they're heavy, and it's tiresome to be\nalways carrying them about with you.\" But one of the other Foxes said,\n\"My friend, if you hadn't lost your own tail, you wouldn't be so keen\non getting us to cut off ours.\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE VAIN JACKDAW\n\n\nJupiter announced that he intended to appoint a king over the birds,\nand named a day on which they were to appear before his throne, when\nhe would select the most beautiful of them all to be their ruler.\nWishing to look their best on the occasion they repaired to the banks\nof a stream, where they busied themselves in washing and preening\ntheir feathers. The Jackdaw was there along with the rest, and\nrealised that, with his ugly plumage, he would have no chance of being\nchosen as he was: so he waited till they were all gone, and then\npicked up the most gaudy of the feathers they had dropped, and\nfastened them about his own body, with the result that he looked gayer\nthan any of them. When the appointed day came, the birds assembled\nbefore Jupiter's throne; and, after passing them in review, he was\nabout to make the Jackdaw king, when all the rest set upon the\nking-elect, stripped him of his borrowed plumes, and exposed him for\nthe Jackdaw that he was.\n\n\n\n\nTHE TRAVELLER AND HIS DOG\n\n\nA Traveller was about to start on a journey, and said to his Dog, who\nwas stretching himself by the door, \"Come, what are you yawning for?\nHurry up and get ready: I mean you to go with me.\" But the Dog merely\nwagged his tail and said quietly, \"I'm ready, master: it's you I'm\nwaiting for.\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE SHIPWRECKED MAN AND THE SEA\n\n\nA Shipwrecked Man cast up on the beach fell asleep after his struggle\nwith the waves. When he woke up, he bitterly reproached the Sea for\nits treachery in enticing men with its smooth and smiling surface,\nand then, when they were well embarked, turning in fury upon them and\nsending both ship and sailors to destruction. The Sea arose in the\nform of a woman, and replied, \"Lay not the blame on me, O sailor, but\non the Winds. By nature I am as calm and safe as the land itself: but\nthe Winds fall upon me with their gusts and gales, and lash me into a\nfury that is not natural to me.\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE WILD BOAR AND THE FOX\n\n\nA Wild Boar was engaged in whetting his tusks upon the trunk of a tree\nin the forest when a Fox came by and, seeing what he was at, said to\nhim, \"Why are you doing that, pray? The huntsmen are not out to-day,\nand there are no other dangers at hand that I can see.\" \"True, my\nfriend,\" replied the Boar, \"but the instant my life is in danger I\nshall need to use my tusks. There'll be no time to sharpen them then.\"\n\n\n\n\nMERCURY AND THE SCULPTOR\n\n\nMercury was very anxious to know in what estimation he was held by\nmankind; so he disguised himself as a man and walked into a Sculptor's\nstudio, where there were a number of statues finished and ready for\nsale. Seeing a statue of Jupiter among the rest, he inquired the price\nof it. \"A crown,\" said the Sculptor. \"Is that all?\" said he, laughing;\n\"and\" (pointing to one of Juno) \"how much is that one?\" \"That,\" was\nthe reply, \"is half a crown.\" \"And how much might you be wanting for\nthat one over there, now?\" he continued, pointing to a statue of\nhimself. \"That one?\" said the Sculptor; \"Oh, I'll throw him in for\nnothing if you'll buy the other two.\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE FAWN AND HIS MOTHER\n\n\nA Hind said to her Fawn, who was now well grown and strong, \"My son,\nNature has given you a powerful body and a stout pair of horns, and I\ncan't think why you are such a coward as to run away from the hounds.\"\nJust then they both heard the sound of a pack in full cry, but at a\nconsiderable distance. \"You stay where you are,\" said the Hind; \"never\nmind me\": and with that she ran off as fast as her legs could carry\nher.\n\n\n\n\nTHE FOX AND THE LION\n\n\nA Fox who had never seen a Lion one day met one, and was so terrified\nat the sight of him that he was ready to die with fear. After a time\nhe met him again, and was still rather frightened, but not nearly so\nmuch as he had been when he met him first. But when he saw him for the\nthird time he was so far from being afraid that he went up to him and\nbegan to talk to him as if he had known him all his life.\n\n\n\n\nTHE EAGLE AND HIS CAPTOR\n\n\nA Man once caught an Eagle, and after clipping his wings turned him\nloose among the fowls in his hen-house, where he moped in a corner,\nlooking very dejected and forlorn. After a while his Captor was glad\nenough to sell him to a neighbour, who took him home and let his wings\ngrow again. As soon as he had recovered the use of them, the Eagle\nflew out and caught a hare, which he brought home and presented to his\nbenefactor. A fox observed this, and said to the Eagle, \"Don't waste\nyour gifts on him! Go and give them to the man who first caught you;\nmake _him_ your friend, and then perhaps he won't catch you and clip\nyour wings a second time.\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE BLACKSMITH AND HIS DOG\n\n\nA Blacksmith had a little Dog, which used to sleep when his master was\nat work, but was very wide awake indeed when it was time for meals.\nOne day his master pretended to be disgusted at this, and when he had\nthrown him a bone as usual, he said, \"What on earth is the good of a\nlazy cur like you? When I am hammering away at my anvil, you just curl\nup and go to sleep: but no sooner do I stop for a mouthful of food\nthan you wake up and wag your tail to be fed.\"\n\n    Those who will not work deserve to starve.\n\n\n\n\nTHE STAG AT THE POOL\n\n\nA thirsty Stag went down to a pool to drink. As he bent over the\nsurface he saw his own reflection in the water, and was struck with\nadmiration for his fine spreading antlers, but at the same time he\nfelt nothing but disgust for the weakness and slenderness of his legs.\nWhile he stood there looking at himself, he was seen and attacked by\na Lion; but in the chase which ensued, he soon drew away from his\npursuer, and kept his lead as long as the ground over which he ran was\nopen and free of trees. But coming presently to a wood, he was caught\nby his antlers in the branches, and fell a victim to the teeth and\nclaws of his enemy. \"Woe is me!\" he cried with his last breath; \"I\ndespised my legs, which might have saved my life: but I gloried in my\nhorns, and they have proved my ruin.\"\n\n    What is worth most is often valued least.\n\n\n\n\nTHE DOG AND THE SHADOW\n\n\nA Dog was crossing a plank bridge over a stream with a piece of meat\nin his mouth, when he happened to see his own reflection in the water.\nHe thought it was another dog with a piece of meat twice as big; so\nhe let go his own, and flew at the other dog to get the larger piece.\nBut, of course, all that happened was that he got neither; for one was\nonly a shadow, and the other was carried away by the current.\n\n\n\n\nMERCURY AND THE TRADESMEN\n\n\nWhen Jupiter was creating man, he told Mercury to make an infusion of\nlies, and to add a little of it to the other ingredients which went to\nthe making of the Tradesmen. Mercury did so, and introduced an equal\namount into each in turn--the tallow-chandler, and the greengrocer,\nand the haberdasher, and all, till he came to the horse-dealer, who\nwas last on the list, when, finding that he had a quantity of the\ninfusion still left, he put it all into him. This is why all Tradesmen\nlie more or less, but they none of them lie like a horse-dealer.\n\n\n\n\nTHE MICE AND THE WEASELS\n\n\nThere was war between the Mice and the Weasels, in which the Mice\nalways got the worst of it, numbers of them being killed and eaten by\nthe Weasels. So they called a council of war, in which an old Mouse\ngot up and said, \"It's no wonder we are always beaten, for we have no\ngenerals to plan our battles and direct our movements in the field.\"\nActing on his advice, they chose the biggest Mice to be their leaders,\nand these, in order to be distinguished from the rank and file,\nprovided themselves with helmets bearing large plumes of straw. They\nthen led out the Mice to battle, confident of victory: but they were\ndefeated as usual, and were soon scampering as fast as they could to\ntheir holes. All made their way to safety without difficulty except\nthe leaders, who were so hampered by the badges of their rank that\nthey could not get into their holes, and fell easy victims to their\npursuers.\n\n    Greatness carries its own penalties.\n\n\n\n\nTHE PEACOCK AND JUNO\n\n\nThe Peacock was greatly discontented because he had not a beautiful\nvoice like the nightingale, and he went and complained to Juno about\nit. \"The nightingale's song,\" said he, \"is the envy of all the birds;\nbut whenever I utter a sound I become a laughing-stock.\" The goddess\ntried to console him by saying, \"You have not, it is true, the power\nof song, but then you far excel all the rest in beauty: your neck\nflashes like the emerald and your splendid tail is a marvel of\ngorgeous colour.\" But the Peacock was not appeased. \"What is the use,\"\nsaid he, \"of being beautiful, with a voice like mine?\" Then Juno\nreplied, with a shade of sternness in her tones, \"Fate has allotted to\nall their destined gifts: to yourself beauty, to the eagle strength,\nto the nightingale song, and so on to all the rest in their degree;\nbut you alone are dissatisfied with your portion. Make, then, no more\ncomplaints. For, if your present wish were granted, you would quickly\nfind cause for fresh discontent.\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE BEAR AND THE FOX\n\n\nA Bear was once bragging about his generous feelings, and saying how\nrefined he was compared with other animals. (There is, in fact, a\ntradition that a Bear will never touch a dead body.) A Fox, who heard\nhim talking in this strain, smiled and said, \"My friend, when you are\nhungry, I only wish you _would_ confine your attention to the dead and\nleave the living alone.\"\n\n    A hypocrite deceives no one but himself.\n\n\n\n\nTHE ASS AND THE OLD PEASANT\n\n\nAn old Peasant was sitting in a meadow watching his Ass, which was\ngrazing close by, when all of a sudden he caught sight of armed men\nstealthily approaching. He jumped up in a moment, and begged the Ass\nto fly with him as fast as he could, \"Or else,\" said he, \"we shall\nboth be captured by the enemy.\" But the Ass just looked round lazily\nand said, \"And if so, do you think they'll make me carry heavier loads\nthan I have to now?\" \"No,\" said his master. \"Oh, well, then,\" said the\nAss, \"I don't mind if they do take me, for I shan't be any worse off.\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE OX AND THE FROG\n\n\nTwo little Frogs were playing about at the edge of a pool when an Ox\ncame down to the water to drink, and by accident trod on one of them\nand crushed the life out of him. When the old Frog missed him, she\nasked his brother where he was. \"He is dead, mother,\" said the little\nFrog; \"an enormous big creature with four legs came to our pool this\nmorning and trampled him down in the mud.\" \"Enormous, was he? Was he\nas big as this?\" said the Frog, puffing herself out to look as big\nas possible. \"Oh! yes, _much_ bigger,\" was the answer. The Frog puffed\nherself out still more. \"Was he as big as this?\" said she. \"Oh! yes,\nyes, mother, _MUCH_ bigger,\" said the little Frog. And yet again she\npuffed and puffed herself out till she was almost as round as a ball.\n\"As big as...?\" she began--but then she burst.\n\n\n\n\nTHE MAN AND THE IMAGE\n\n\nA poor Man had a wooden Image of a god, to which he used to pray daily\nfor riches. He did this for a long time, but remained as poor as ever,\ntill one day he caught up the Image in disgust and hurled it with all\nhis strength against the wall. The force of the blow split open the\nhead and a quantity of gold coins fell out upon the floor. The Man\ngathered them up greedily, and said, \"O you old fraud, you! When I\nhonoured you, you did me no good whatever: but no sooner do I treat\nyou to insults and violence than you make a rich man of me!\"\n\n\n\n\nHERCULES AND THE WAGGONER\n\n\nA Waggoner was driving his team along a muddy lane with a full load\nbehind them, when the wheels of his waggon sank so deep in the mire\nthat no efforts of his horses could move them. As he stood there,\nlooking helplessly on, and calling loudly at intervals upon Hercules\nfor assistance, the god himself appeared, and said to him, \"Put your\nshoulder to the wheel, man, and goad on your horses, and then you may\ncall on Hercules to assist you. If you won't lift a finger to help\nyourself, you can't expect Hercules or any one else to come to your\naid.\"\n\n    Heaven helps those who help themselves.\n\n\n\n\nTHE POMEGRANATE, THE APPLE-TREE, AND THE BRAMBLE\n\n\nA Pomegranate and an Apple-tree were disputing about the quality of\ntheir fruits, and each claimed that its own was the better of the two.\nHigh words passed between them, and a violent quarrel was imminent,\nwhen a Bramble impudently poked its head out of a neighbouring hedge\nand said, \"There, that's enough, my friends; don't let us quarrel.\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE LION, THE BEAR, AND THE FOX\n\n\nA Lion and a Bear were fighting for possession of a kid, which they\nhad both seized at the same moment. The battle was long and fierce,\nand at length both of them were exhausted, and lay upon the ground\nseverely wounded and gasping for breath. A Fox had all the time been\nprowling round and watching the fight: and when he saw the combatants\nlying there too weak to move, he slipped in and seized the kid, and\nran off with it. They looked on helplessly, and one said to the other,\n\"Here we've been mauling each other all this while, and no one the\nbetter for it except the Fox!\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE BLACKAMOOR\n\n\nA Man once bought an Ethiopian slave, who had a black skin like all\nEthiopians; but his new master thought his colour was due to his\nlate owner's having neglected him, and that all he wanted was a good\nscrubbing. So he set to work with plenty of soap and hot water, and\nrubbed away at him with a will, but all to no purpose: his skin\nremained as black as ever, while the poor wretch all but died from the\ncold he caught.\n\n\n\n\nTHE TWO SOLDIERS AND THE ROBBER\n\n\nTwo Soldiers travelling together were set upon by a Robber. One of\nthem ran away, but the other stood his ground, and laid about him so\nlustily with his sword that the Robber was fain to fly and leave\nhim in peace. When the coast was clear the timid one ran back, and,\nflourishing his weapon, cried in a threatening voice, \"Where is he?\nLet me get at him, and I'll soon let him know whom he's got to deal\nwith.\" But the other replied, \"You are a little late, my friend: I\nonly wish you had backed me up just now, even if you had done no more\nthan speak, for I should have been encouraged, believing your words to\nbe true. As it is, calm yourself, and put up your sword: there is no\nfurther use for it. You may delude others into thinking you're as\nbrave as a lion: but I know that, at the first sign of danger, you run\naway like a hare.\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE LION AND THE WILD ASS\n\n\nA Lion and a Wild Ass went out hunting together: the latter was to run\ndown the prey by his superior speed, and the former would then come\nup and despatch it. They met with great success; and when it came to\nsharing the spoil the Lion divided it all into three equal portions.\n\"I will take the first,\" said he, \"because I am King of the beasts; I\nwill also take the second, because, as your partner, I am entitled to\nhalf of what remains; and as for the third--well, unless you give it\nup to me and take yourself off pretty quick, the third, believe me,\nwill make you feel very sorry for yourself!\"\n\n    Might makes right.\n\n\n\n\nTHE MAN AND THE SATYR\n\n\nA Man and a Satyr became friends, and determined to live together. All\nwent well for a while, until one day in winter-time the Satyr saw the\nMan blowing on his hands. \"Why do you do that?\" he asked. \"To warm\nmy hands,\" said the Man. That same day, when they sat down to supper\ntogether, they each had a steaming hot bowl of porridge, and the Man\nraised his bowl to his mouth and blew on it. \"Why do you do that?\"\nasked the Satyr. \"To cool my porridge,\" said the Man. The Satyr got up\nfrom the table. \"Good-bye,\" said he, \"I'm going: I can't be friends\nwith a man who blows hot and cold with the same breath.\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE IMAGE-SELLER\n\n\nA certain man made a wooden Image of Mercury, and exposed it for sale\nin the market. As no one offered to buy it, however, he thought he\nwould try to attract a purchaser by proclaiming the virtues of the\nImage. So he cried up and down the market, \"A god for sale! a god for\nsale! One who'll bring you luck and keep you lucky!\" Presently one of\nthe bystanders stopped him and said, \"If your god is all you make\nhim out to be, how is it you don't keep him and make the most of him\nyourself?\" \"I'll tell you why,\" replied he; \"he brings gain, it is\ntrue, but he takes his time about it; whereas I want money at once.\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE EAGLE AND THE ARROW\n\n\nAn Eagle sat perched on a lofty rock, keeping a sharp look-out for\nprey. A huntsman, concealed in a cleft of the mountain and on the\nwatch for game, spied him there and shot an Arrow at him. The shaft\nstruck him full in the breast and pierced him through and through. As\nhe lay in the agonies of death, he turned his eyes upon the Arrow.\n\"Ah! cruel fate!\" he cried, \"that I should perish thus: but oh! fate\nmore cruel still, that the Arrow which kills me should be winged with\nan Eagle's feathers!\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE RICH MAN AND THE TANNER\n\n\nA Rich Man took up his residence next door to a Tanner, and found the\nsmell of the tan-yard so extremely unpleasant that he told him he must\ngo. The Tanner delayed his departure, and the Rich Man had to speak\nto him several times about it; and every time the Tanner said he was\nmaking arrangements to move very shortly. This went on for some time,\ntill at last the Rich Man got so used to the smell that he ceased to\nmind it, and troubled the Tanner with his objections no more.\n\n\n\n\nTHE WOLF, THE MOTHER, AND HER CHILD\n\n\nA hungry Wolf was prowling about in search of food. By and by,\nattracted by the cries of a Child, he came to a cottage. As he\ncrouched beneath the window, he heard the Mother say to the Child,\n\"Stop crying, do! or I'll throw you to the Wolf.\" Thinking she really\nmeant what she said, he waited there a long time in the expectation of\nsatisfying his hunger. In the evening he heard the Mother fondling her\nChild and saying, \"If the naughty Wolf comes, he shan't get my little\none: Daddy will kill him.\" The Wolf got up in much disgust and walked\naway: \"As for the people in that house,\" said he to himself, \"you\ncan't believe a word they say.\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE OLD WOMAN AND THE WINE-JAR\n\n\nAn old Woman picked up an empty Wine-jar which had once contained a\nrare and costly wine, and which still retained some traces of its\nexquisite bouquet. She raised it to her nose and sniffed at it again\nand again. \"Ah,\" she cried, \"how delicious must have been the liquid\nwhich has left behind so ravishing a smell.\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE LIONESS AND THE VIXEN\n\n\nA Lioness and a Vixen were talking together about their young, as\nmothers will, and saying how healthy and well-grown they were, and\nwhat beautiful coats they had, and how they were the image of their\nparents. \"My litter of cubs is a joy to see,\" said the Fox; and then\nshe added, rather maliciously, \"But I notice you never have more than\none.\" \"No,\" said the Lioness grimly, \"but that one's a lion.\"\n\n    Quality, not quantity.\n\n\n\n\nTHE VIPER AND THE FILE\n\n\nA Viper entered a carpenter's shop, and went from one to another of\nthe tools, begging for something to eat. Among the rest, he addressed\nhimself to the File, and asked for the favour of a meal. The File\nreplied in a tone of pitying contempt, \"What a simpleton you must be\nif you imagine you will get anything from me, who invariably take from\nevery one and never give anything in return.\"\n\n    The covetous are poor givers.\n\n\n\n\nTHE CAT AND THE COCK\n\n\nA Cat pounced on a Cock, and cast about for some good excuse for\nmaking a meal off him, for Cats don't as a rule eat Cocks, and she\nknew she ought not to. At last she said, \"You make a great nuisance of\nyourself at night by crowing and keeping people awake: so I am going\nto make an end of you.\" But the Cock defended himself by saying that\nhe crowed in order that men might wake up and set about the day's work\nin good time, and that they really couldn't very well do without him.\n\"That may be,\" said the Cat, \"but whether they can or not, I'm not\ngoing without my dinner\"; and she killed and ate him.\n\n    The want of a good excuse never kept a villain from crime.\n\n\n\n\nTHE HARE AND THE TORTOISE\n\n\nA Hare was one day making fun of a Tortoise for being so slow upon his\nfeet. \"Wait a bit,\" said the Tortoise; \"I'll run a race with you, and\nI'll wager that I win.\" \"Oh, well,\" replied the Hare, who was much\namused at the idea, \"let's try and see\"; and it was soon agreed that\nthe fox should set a course for them, and be the judge. When the time\ncame both started off together, but the Hare was soon so far ahead\nthat he thought he might as well have a rest: so down he lay and fell\nfast asleep. Meanwhile the Tortoise kept plodding on, and in time\nreached the goal. At last the Hare woke up with a start, and dashed on\nat his fastest, but only to find that the Tortoise had already won the\nrace.\n\n    Slow and steady wins the race.\n\n\n\n\nTHE SOLDIER AND HIS HORSE\n\n\nA Soldier gave his Horse a plentiful supply of oats in time of war,\nand tended him with the utmost care, for he wished him to be strong to\nendure the hardships of the field, and swift to bear his master, when\nneed arose, out of the reach of danger. But when the war was over he\nemployed him on all sorts of drudgery, bestowing but little attention\nupon him, and giving him, moreover, nothing but chaff to eat. The time\ncame when war broke out again, and the Soldier saddled and bridled his\nHorse, and, having put on his heavy coat of mail, mounted him to ride\noff and take the field. But the poor half-starved beast sank down\nunder his weight, and said to his rider, \"You will have to go into\nbattle on foot this time. Thanks to hard work and bad food, you have\nturned me from a Horse into an ass; and you cannot in a moment turn me\nback again into a Horse.\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE OXEN AND THE BUTCHERS\n\n\nOnce upon a time the Oxen determined to be revenged upon the Butchers\nfor the havoc they wrought in their ranks, and plotted to put them to\ndeath on a given day. They were all gathered together discussing how\nbest to carry out the plan, and the more violent of them were engaged\nin sharpening their horns for the fray, when an old Ox got up upon his\nfeet and said, \"My brothers, you have good reason, I know, to hate\nthese Butchers, but, at any rate, they understand their trade and do\nwhat they have to do without causing unnecessary pain. But if we kill\nthem, others, who have no experience, will be set to slaughter us, and\nwill by their bungling inflict great sufferings upon us. For you may\nbe sure that, even though all the Butchers perish, mankind will never\ngo without their beef.\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE WOLF AND THE LION\n\n\nA wolf stole a lamb from the flock, and was carrying it off to devour\nit at his leisure when he met a Lion, who took his prey away from him\nand walked off with it. He dared not resist, but when the Lion had\ngone some distance he said, \"It is most unjust of you to take what's\nmine away from me like that.\" The Lion laughed and called out in\nreply, \"It was justly yours, no doubt! The gift of a friend, perhaps,\neh?\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE SHEEP, THE WOLF, AND THE STAG\n\n\nA Stag once asked a Sheep to lend him a measure of wheat, saying that\nhis friend the Wolf would be his surety. The Sheep, however, was\nafraid that they meant to cheat her; so she excused herself, saying,\n\"The Wolf is in the habit of seizing what he wants and running off\nwith it without paying, and you, too, can run much faster than I. So\nhow shall I be able to come up with either of you when the debt falls\ndue?\"\n\n    Two blacks do not make a white.\n\n\n\n\nTHE LION AND THE THREE BULLS\n\n\nThree Bulls were grazing in a meadow, and were watched by a Lion, who\nlonged to capture and devour them, but who felt that he was no match\nfor the three so long as they kept together. So he began by false\nwhispers and malicious hints to foment jealousies and distrust among\nthem. This stratagem succeeded so well that ere long the Bulls grew\ncold and unfriendly, and finally avoided each other and fed each one\nby himself apart. No sooner did the Lion see this than he fell upon\nthem one by one and killed them in turn.\n\n    The quarrels of friends are the opportunities of foes.\n\n\n\n\nTHE HORSE AND HIS RIDER\n\n\nA Young Man, who fancied himself something of a horseman, mounted\na Horse which had not been properly broken in, and was exceedingly\ndifficult to control. No sooner did the Horse feel his weight in the\nsaddle than he bolted, and nothing would stop him. A friend of the\nRider's met him in the road in his headlong career, and called out,\n\"Where are you off to in such a hurry?\" To which he, pointing to the\nHorse, replied, \"I've no idea: ask him.\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE GOAT AND THE VINE\n\n\nA Goat was straying in a vineyard, and began to browse on the tender\nshoots of a Vine which bore several fine bunches of grapes. \"What have\nI done to you,\" said the Vine, \"that you should harm me thus? Isn't\nthere grass enough for you to feed on? All the same, even if you eat\nup every leaf I have, and leave me quite bare, I shall produce\nwine enough to pour over you when you are led to the altar to be\nsacrificed.\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE TWO POTS\n\n\nTwo Pots, one of earthenware and the other of brass, were carried away\ndown a river in flood. The Brazen Pot urged his companion to keep\nclose by his side, and he would protect him. The other thanked him,\nbut begged him not to come near him on any account: \"For that,\" he\nsaid, \"is just what I am most afraid of. One touch from you and I\nshould be broken in pieces.\"\n\n    Equals make the best friends.\n\n\n\n\nTHE OLD HOUND\n\n\nA Hound who had served his master well for years, and had run down\nmany a quarry in his time, began to lose his strength and speed owing\nto age. One day, when out hunting, his master started a powerful wild\nboar and set the Hound at him. The latter seized the beast by the ear,\nbut his teeth were gone and he could not retain his hold; so the\nboar escaped. His master began to scold him severely, but the Hound\ninterrupted him with these words: \"My will is as strong as ever,\nmaster, but my body is old and feeble. You ought to honour me for what\nI have been instead of abusing me for what I am.\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE CLOWN AND THE COUNTRYMAN\n\n\nA Nobleman announced his intention of giving a public entertainment in\nthe theatre, and offered splendid prizes to all who had any novelty\nto exhibit at the performance. The announcement attracted a crowd of\nconjurers, jugglers, and acrobats, and among the rest a Clown, very\npopular with the crowd, who let it be known that he was going to\ngive an entirely new turn. When the day of the performance came,\nthe theatre was filled from top to bottom some time before the\nentertainment began. Several performers exhibited their tricks, and\nthen the popular favourite came on empty-handed and alone. At once\nthere was a hush of expectation: and he, letting his head fall upon\nhis breast, imitated the squeak of a pig to such perfection that the\naudience insisted on his producing the animal, which, they said, he\nmust have somewhere concealed about his person. He, however, convinced\nthem that there was no pig there, and then the applause was deafening.\nAmong the spectators was a Countryman, who disparaged the Clown's\nperformance and announced that he would give a much superior\nexhibition of the same trick on the following day. Again the theatre\nwas filled to overflowing, and again the Clown gave his imitation\namidst the cheers of the crowd. The Countryman, meanwhile, before\ngoing on the stage, had secreted a young porker under his smock; and\nwhen the spectators derisively bade him do better if he could, he gave\nit a pinch in the ear and made it squeal loudly. But they all with one\nvoice shouted out that the Clown's imitation was much more true to\nlife. Thereupon he produced the pig from under his smock and said\nsarcastically, \"There, that shows what sort of judges you are!\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE LARK AND THE FARMER\n\n\nA Lark nested in a field of corn, and was rearing her brood under\ncover of the ripening grain. One day, before the young were fully\nfledged, the Farmer came to look at the crop, and, finding it\nyellowing fast, he said, \"I must send round word to my neighbours to\ncome and help me reap this field.\" One of the young Larks overheard\nhim, and was very much frightened, and asked her mother whether they\nhadn't better move house at once. \"There's no hurry,\" replied she;\n\"a man who looks to his friends for help will take his time about a\nthing.\" In a few days the Farmer came by again, and saw that the grain\nwas overripe and falling out of the ears upon the ground. \"I must put\nit off no longer,\" he said; \"This very day I'll hire the men and set\nthem to work at once.\" The Lark heard him and said to her young,\n\"Come, my children, we must be off: he talks no more of his friends\nnow, but is going to take things in hand himself.\"\n\n    Self-help is the best help.\n\n\n\n\nTHE LION AND THE ASS\n\n\nA Lion and an Ass set up as partners and went a-hunting together. In\ncourse of time they came to a cave in which there were a number of\nwild goats. The Lion took up his stand at the mouth of the cave, and\nwaited for them to come out; while the Ass went inside and brayed for\nall he was worth in order to frighten them out into the open. The Lion\nstruck them down one by one as they appeared; and when the cave was\nempty the Ass came out and said, \"Well, I scared them pretty well,\ndidn't I?\" \"I should think you did,\" said the Lion: \"why, if I hadn't\nknown you were an Ass, I should have turned and run myself.\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE PROPHET\n\n\nA Prophet sat in the market-place and told the fortunes of all who\ncared to engage his services. Suddenly there came running up one who\ntold him that his house had been broken into by thieves, and that they\nhad made off with everything they could lay hands on. He was up in a\nmoment, and rushed off, tearing his hair and calling down curses on\nthe miscreants. The bystanders were much amused, and one of them said,\n\"Our friend professes to know what is going to happen to others,\nbut it seems he's not clever enough to perceive what's in store for\nhimself.\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE HOUND AND THE HARE\n\n\nA young Hound started a Hare, and, when he caught her up, would at one\nmoment snap at her with his teeth as though he were about to kill her,\nwhile at another he would let go his hold and frisk about her, as if\nhe were playing with another dog. At last the Hare said, \"I wish you\nwould show yourself in your true colours! If you are my friend, why do\nyou bite me? If you are my enemy, why do you play with me?\"\n\n    He is no friend who plays double.\n\n\n\n\nTHE LION, THE MOUSE, AND THE FOX\n\n\nA Lion was lying asleep at the mouth of his den when a Mouse ran over\nhis back and tickled him so that he woke up with a start and began\nlooking about everywhere to see what it was that had disturbed him. A\nFox, who was looking on, thought he would have a joke at the expense\nof the Lion; so he said, \"Well, this is the first time I've seen a\nLion afraid of a Mouse.\" \"Afraid of a Mouse?\" said the Lion testily:\n\"not I! It's his bad manners I can't stand.\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE TRUMPETER TAKEN PRISONER\n\n\nA Trumpeter marched into battle in the van of the army and put courage\ninto his comrades by his warlike tunes. Being captured by the enemy,\nhe begged for his life, and said, \"Do not put me to death; I have\nkilled no one: indeed, I have no weapons, but carry with me only my\ntrumpet here.\" But his captors replied, \"That is only the more reason\nwhy we should take your life; for, though you do not fight yourself,\nyou stir up others to do so.\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE WOLF AND THE CRANE\n\n\nA Wolf once got a bone stuck in his throat. So he went to a Crane and\nbegged her to put her long bill down his throat and pull it out. \"I'll\nmake it worth your while,\" he added. The Crane did as she was asked,\nand got the bone out quite easily. The Wolf thanked her warmly, and\nwas just turning away, when she cried, \"What about that fee of mine?\"\n\"Well, what about it?\" snapped the Wolf, baring his teeth as he spoke;\n\"you can go about boasting that you once put your head into a Wolf's\nmouth and didn't get it bitten off. What more do you want?\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE EAGLE, THE CAT, AND THE WILD SOW\n\n\nAn Eagle built her nest at the top of a high tree; a Cat with her\nfamily occupied a hollow in the trunk half-way down; and a Wild Sow\nand her young took up their quarters at the foot. They might have got\non very well as neighbours had it not been for the evil cunning of the\nCat. Climbing up to the Eagle's nest she said to the Eagle, \"You and I\nare in the greatest possible danger. That dreadful creature, the Sow,\nwho is always to be seen grubbing away at the foot of the tree, means\nto uproot it, that she may devour your family and mine at her ease.\"\nHaving thus driven the Eagle almost out of her senses with terror, the\nCat climbed down the tree, and said to the Sow, \"I must warn you\nagainst that dreadful bird, the Eagle. She is only waiting her chance\nto fly down and carry off one of your little pigs when you take them\nout, to feed her brood with.\" She succeeded in frightening the Sow as\nmuch as the Eagle. Then she returned to her hole in the trunk, from\nwhich, feigning to be afraid, she never came forth by day. Only by\nnight did she creep out unseen to procure food for her kittens. The\nEagle, meanwhile was afraid to stir from her nest, and the Sow dared\nnot leave her home among the roots: so that in time both they and\ntheir families perished of hunger, and their dead bodies supplied the\nCat with ample food for her growing family.\n\n\n\n\nTHE WOLF AND THE SHEEP\n\n\nA Wolf was worried and badly bitten by dogs, and lay a long time for\ndead. By and by he began to revive, and, feeling very hungry, called\nout to a passing Sheep and said, \"Would you kindly bring me some water\nfrom the stream close by? I can manage about meat, if only I could\nget something to drink.\" But this Sheep was no fool. \"I can quite\nunderstand\", said he, \"that if I brought you the water, you would have\nno difficulty about the meat. Good-morning.\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE TUNNY-FISH AND THE DOLPHIN\n\n\nA Tunny-fish was chased by a Dolphin and splashed through the water at\na great rate, but the Dolphin gradually gained upon him, and was just\nabout to seize him when the force of his flight carried the Tunny on\nto a sandbank. In the heat of the chase the Dolphin followed him, and\nthere they both lay out of the water, gasping for dear life. When the\nTunny saw that his enemy was doomed like himself, he said, \"I don't\nmind having to die now: for I see that he who is the cause of my death\nis about to share the same fate.\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE THREE TRADESMEN\n\n\nThe citizens of a certain city were debating about the best material\nto use in the fortifications which were about to be erected for the\ngreater security of the town. A Carpenter got up and advised the use\nof wood, which he said was readily procurable and easily worked. A\nStone-mason objected to wood on the ground that it was so inflammable,\nand recommended stones instead. Then a Tanner got on his legs and\nsaid, \"In my opinion there's nothing like leather.\"\n\n    Every man for himself.\n\n\n\n\nTHE MOUSE AND THE BULL\n\n\nA Bull gave chase to a Mouse which had bitten him in the nose: but the\nMouse was too quick for him and slipped into a hole in a wall. The\nBull charged furiously into the wall again and again until he was\ntired out, and sank down on the ground exhausted with his efforts.\nWhen all was quiet, the Mouse darted out and bit him again. Beside\nhimself with rage he started to his feet, but by that time the Mouse\nwas back in his hole again, and he could do nothing but bellow and\nfume in helpless anger. Presently he heard a shrill little voice say\nfrom inside the wall, \"You big fellows don't always have it your own\nway, you see: sometimes we little ones come off best.\"\n\n    The battle is not always to the strong.\n\n\n\n\nTHE HARE AND THE HOUND\n\n\nA Hound started a Hare from her form, and pursued her for some\ndistance; but as she gradually gained upon him, he gave up the chase.\nA rustic who had seen the race met the Hound as he was returning, and\ntaunted him with his defeat. \"The little one was too much for you,\"\nsaid he. \"Ah, well,\" said the Hound, \"don't forget it's one thing to\nbe running for your dinner, but quite another to be running for your\nlife.\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE TOWN MOUSE AND THE COUNTRY MOUSE\n\n\nA Town Mouse and a Country Mouse were acquaintances, and the Country\nMouse one day invited his friend to come and see him at his home in\nthe fields. The Town Mouse came, and they sat down to a dinner of\nbarleycorns and roots, the latter of which had a distinctly earthy\nflavour. The fare was not much to the taste of the guest, and\npresently he broke out with \"My poor dear friend, you live here no\nbetter than the ants. Now, you should just see how I fare! My larder\nis a regular horn of plenty. You must come and stay with me, and\nI promise you you shall live on the fat of the land.\" So when he\nreturned to town he took the Country Mouse with him, and showed him\ninto a larder containing flour and oatmeal and figs and honey and\ndates. The Country Mouse had never seen anything like it, and sat down\nto enjoy the luxuries his friend provided: but before they had well\nbegun, the door of the larder opened and some one came in. The two\nMice scampered off and hid themselves in a narrow and exceedingly\nuncomfortable hole. Presently, when all was quiet, they ventured out\nagain; but some one else came in, and off they scuttled again. This\nwas too much for the visitor. \"Good-bye,\" said he, \"I'm off. You live\nin the lap of luxury, I can see, but you are surrounded by dangers;\nwhereas at home I can enjoy my simple dinner of roots and corn in\npeace.\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE LION AND THE BULL\n\n\nA Lion saw a fine fat Bull pasturing among a herd of cattle and cast\nabout for some means of getting him into his clutches; so he sent him\nword that he was sacrificing a sheep, and asked if he would do him the\nhonour of dining with him. The Bull accepted the invitation, but, on\narriving at the Lion's den, he saw a great array of saucepans and\nspits, but no sign of a sheep; so he turned on his heel and walked\nquietly away. The Lion called after him in an injured tone to ask the\nreason, and the Bull turned round and said, \"I have reason enough.\nWhen I saw all your preparations it struck me at once that the victim\nwas to be a Bull and not a sheep.\"\n\n    The net is spread in vain in sight of the bird.\n\n\n\n\nTHE WOLF, THE FOX, AND THE APE\n\n\nA Wolf charged a Fox with theft, which he denied, and the case was\nbrought before an Ape to be tried. When he had heard the evidence on\nboth sides, the Ape gave judgment as follows: \"I do not think,\" he\nsaid, \"that you, O Wolf, ever lost what you claim; but all the same I\nbelieve that you, Fox, are guilty of the theft, in spite of all your\ndenials.\"\n\n    The dishonest get no credit, even if they act honestly.\n\n\n\n\nTHE EAGLE AND THE COCKS\n\n\nThere were two Cocks in the same farmyard, and they fought to decide\nwho should be master. When the fight was over, the beaten one went and\nhid himself in a dark corner; while the victor flew up on to the roof\nof the stables and crowed lustily. But an Eagle espied him from high\nup in the sky, and swooped down and carried him off. Forthwith the\nother Cock came out of his corner and ruled the roost without a rival.\n\n    Pride comes before a fall.\n\n\n\n\nTHE ESCAPED JACKDAW\n\n\nA Man caught a Jackdaw and tied a piece of string to one of its legs,\nand then gave it to his children for a pet. But the Jackdaw didn't at\nall like having to live with people; so, after a while, when he seemed\nto have become fairly tame and they didn't watch him so closely, he\nslipped away and flew back to his old haunts. Unfortunately, the\nstring was still on his leg, and before long it got entangled in the\nbranches of a tree and the Jackdaw couldn't get free, try as he would.\nHe saw it was all up with him, and cried in despair, \"Alas, in gaining\nmy freedom I have lost my life.\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE FARMER AND THE FOX\n\n\nA Farmer was greatly annoyed by a Fox, which came prowling about his\nyard at night and carried off his fowls. So he set a trap for him and\ncaught him; and in order to be revenged upon him, he tied a bunch of\ntow to his tail and set fire to it and let him go. As ill-luck would\nhave it, however, the Fox made straight for the fields where the corn\nwas standing ripe and ready for cutting. It quickly caught fire and\nwas all burnt up, and the Farmer lost all his harvest.\n\n    Revenge is a two-edged sword.\n\n\n\n\nVENUS AND THE CAT\n\n\nA Cat fell in love with a handsome young man, and begged the goddess\nVenus to change her into a woman. Venus was very gracious about it,\nand changed her at once into a beautiful maiden, whom the young man\nfell in love with at first sight and shortly afterwards married. One\nday Venus thought she would like to see whether the Cat had changed\nher habits as well as her form; so she let a mouse run loose in the\nroom where they were. Forgetting everything, the young woman had no\nsooner seen the mouse than up she jumped and was after it like a shot:\nat which the goddess was so disgusted that she changed her back again\ninto a Cat.\n\n\n\n\nTHE CROW AND THE SWAN\n\n\nA Crow was filled with envy on seeing the beautiful white plumage of a\nSwan, and thought it was due to the water in which the Swan constantly\nbathed and swam. So he left the neighbourhood of the altars, where he\ngot his living by picking up bits of the meat offered in sacrifice,\nand went and lived among the pools and streams. But though he bathed\nand washed his feathers many times a day, he didn't make them any\nwhiter, and at last died of hunger into the bargain.\n\n    You may change your habits, but not your nature.\n\n\n\n\nTHE STAG WITH ONE EYE\n\n\nA Stag, blind of one eye, was grazing close to the sea-shore and kept\nhis sound eye turned towards the land, so as to be able to perceive\nthe approach of the hounds, while the blind eye he turned towards the\nsea, never suspecting that any danger would threaten him from that\nquarter. As it fell out, however, some sailors, coasting along the\nshore, spied him and shot an arrow at him, by which he was mortally\nwounded. As he lay dying, he said to himself, \"Wretch that I am! I\nbethought me of the dangers of the land, whence none assailed me: but\nI feared no peril from the sea, yet thence has come my ruin.\"\n\n    Misfortune often assails us from an unexpected quarter.\n\n\n\n\nTHE FLY AND THE DRAUGHT-MULE\n\n\nA Fly sat on one of the shafts of a cart and said to the Mule who was\npulling it, \"How slow you are! Do mend your pace, or I shall have to\nuse my sting as a goad.\" The Mule was not in the least disturbed.\n\"Behind me, in the cart,\" said he, \"sits my master. He holds the\nreins, and flicks me with his whip, and him I obey, but I don't want\nany of your impertinence. _I_ know when I may dawdle and when I may\nnot.\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE COCK AND THE JEWEL\n\n\nA Cock, scratching the ground for something to eat, turned up a Jewel\nthat had by chance been dropped there. \"Ho!\" said he, \"a fine thing\nyou are, no doubt, and, had your owner found you, great would his joy\nhave been. But for me! give me a single grain of corn before all the\njewels in the world.\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE WOLF AND THE SHEPHERD\n\n\nA Wolf hung about near a flock of sheep for a long time, but made no\nattempt to molest them. The Shepherd at first kept a sharp eye on him,\nfor he naturally thought he meant mischief: but as time went by and\nthe Wolf showed no inclination to meddle with the flock, he began to\nlook upon him more as a protector than as an enemy: and when one day\nsome errand took him to the city, he felt no uneasiness at leaving\nthe Wolf with the sheep. But as soon as his back was turned the\nWolf attacked them and killed the greater number. When the Shepherd\nreturned and saw the havoc he had wrought, he cried, \"It serves me\nright for trusting my flock to a Wolf.\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE FARMER AND THE STORK\n\n\nA Farmer set some traps in a field which he had lately sown with corn,\nin order to catch the cranes which came to pick up the seed. When he\nreturned to look at his traps he found several cranes caught, and\namong them a Stork, which begged to be let go, and said, \"You ought\nnot to kill me: I am not a crane, but a Stork, as you can easily see\nby my feathers, and I am the most honest and harmless of birds.\" But\nthe Farmer replied, \"It's nothing to me what you are: I find you among\nthese cranes, who ruin my crops, and, like them, you shall suffer.\"\n\n    If you choose bad companions no one will believe that you are\n    anything but bad yourself.\n\n\n\n\nTHE CHARGER AND THE MILLER\n\n\nA Horse, who had been used to carry his rider into battle, felt\nhimself growing old and chose to work in a mill instead. He now no\nlonger found himself stepping out proudly to the beating of the drums,\nbut was compelled to slave away all day grinding the corn. Bewailing\nhis hard lot, he said one day to the Miller, \"Ah me! I was once a\nsplendid war-horse, gaily caparisoned, and attended by a groom\nwhose sole duty was to see to my wants. How different is my present\ncondition! I wish I had never given up the battlefield for the mill.\"\nThe Miller replied with asperity, \"It's no use your regretting the\npast. Fortune has many ups and downs: you must just take them as they\ncome.\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE GRASSHOPPER AND THE OWL\n\n\nAn Owl, who lived in a hollow tree, was in the habit of feeding by\nnight and sleeping by day; but her slumbers were greatly disturbed\nby the chirping of a Grasshopper, who had taken up his abode in the\nbranches. She begged him repeatedly to have some consideration for her\ncomfort, but the Grasshopper, if anything, only chirped the louder. At\nlast the Owl could stand it no longer, but determined to rid\nherself of the pest by means of a trick. Addressing herself to the\nGrasshopper, she said in her pleasantest manner, \"As I cannot sleep\nfor your song, which, believe me, is as sweet as the notes of Apollo's\nlyre, I have a mind to taste some nectar, which Minerva gave me\nthe other day. Won't you come in and join me?\" The Grasshopper was\nflattered by the praise of his song, and his mouth, too, watered at\nthe mention of the delicious drink, so he said he would be delighted.\nNo sooner had he got inside the hollow where the Owl was sitting than\nshe pounced upon him and ate him up.\n\n\n\n\nTHE GRASSHOPPER AND THE ANTS\n\n\nOne fine day in winter some Ants were busy drying their store of corn,\nwhich had got rather damp during a long spell of rain. Presently up\ncame a Grasshopper and begged them to spare her a few grains, \"For,\"\nshe said, \"I'm simply starving.\" The Ants stopped work for a moment,\nthough this was against their principles. \"May we ask,\" said they,\n\"what you were doing with yourself all last summer? Why didn't you\ncollect a store of food for the winter?\" \"The fact is,\" replied the\nGrasshopper, \"I was so busy singing that I hadn't the time.\" \"If you\nspent the summer singing,\" replied the Ants, \"you can't do better than\nspend the winter dancing.\" And they chuckled and went on with their\nwork.\n\n\n\n\nTHE FARMER AND THE VIPER\n\n\nOne winter a Farmer found a Viper frozen and numb with cold, and out\nof pity picked it up and placed it in his bosom. The Viper was no\nsooner revived by the warmth than it turned upon its benefactor and\ninflicted a fatal bite upon him; and as the poor man lay dying, he\ncried, \"I have only got what I deserved, for taking compassion on so\nvillainous a creature.\"\n\n    Kindness is thrown away upon the evil.\n\n\n\n\nTHE TWO FROGS\n\n\nTwo Frogs were neighbours. One lived in a marsh, where there was\nplenty of water, which frogs love: the other in a lane some distance\naway, where all the water to be had was that which lay in the ruts\nafter rain. The Marsh Frog warned his friend and pressed him to come\nand live with him in the marsh, for he would find his quarters there\nfar more comfortable and--what was still more important--more safe.\nBut the other refused, saying that he could not bring himself to move\nfrom a place to which he had become accustomed. A few days afterwards\na heavy waggon came down the lane, and he was crushed to death under\nthe wheels.\n\n\n\n\nTHE COBBLER TURNED DOCTOR\n\n\nA very unskilful Cobbler, finding himself unable to make a living at\nhis trade, gave up mending boots and took to doctoring instead. He\ngave out that he had the secret of a universal antidote against all\npoisons, and acquired no small reputation, thanks to his talent for\npuffing himself. One day, however, he fell very ill; and the King of\nthe country bethought him that he would test the value of his remedy.\nCalling, therefore, for a cup, he poured out a dose of the antidote,\nand, under pretence of mixing poison with it, added a little water,\nand commanded him to drink it. Terrified by the fear of being\npoisoned, the Cobbler confessed that he knew nothing about medicine,\nand that his antidote was worthless. Then the King summoned his\nsubjects and addressed them as follows: \"What folly could be greater\nthan yours? Here is this Cobbler to whom no one will send his boots\nto be mended, and yet you have not hesitated to entrust him with your\nlives!\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE ASS, THE COCK, AND THE LION\n\n\nAn Ass and a Cock were in a cattle-pen together. Presently a Lion, who\nhad been starving for days, came along and was just about to fall\nupon the Ass and make a meal of him when the Cock, rising to his full\nheight and flapping his wings vigorously, uttered a tremendous crow.\nNow, if there is one thing that frightens a Lion, it is the crowing of\na Cock: and this one had no sooner heard the noise than he fled.\nThe Ass was mightily elated at this, and thought that, if the Lion\ncouldn't face a Cock, he would be still less likely to stand up to an\nAss: so he ran out and pursued him. But when the two had got well out\nof sight and hearing of the Cock, the Lion suddenly turned upon the\nAss and ate him up.\n\n    False confidence often leads to disaster.\n\n\n\n\nTHE BELLY AND THE MEMBERS\n\n\nThe Members of the Body once rebelled against the Belly. \"You,\" they\nsaid to the Belly, \"live in luxury and sloth, and never do a stroke of\nwork; while we not only have to do all the hard work there is to be\ndone, but are actually your slaves and have to minister to all your\nwants. Now, we will do so no longer, and you can shift for yourself\nfor the future.\" They were as good as their word, and left the Belly\nto starve. The result was just what might have been expected: the\nwhole Body soon began to fail, and the Members and all shared in the\ngeneral collapse. And then they saw too late how foolish they had\nbeen.\n\n\n\n\nTHE BALD MAN AND THE FLY\n\n\nA Fly settled on the head of a Bald Man and bit him. In his eagerness\nto kill it, he hit himself a smart slap. But the Fly escaped, and said\nto him in derision, \"You tried to kill me for just one little bite;\nwhat will you do to yourself now, for the heavy smack you have just\ngiven yourself?\" \"Oh, for that blow I bear no grudge,\" he replied,\n\"for I never intended myself any harm; but as for you, you\ncontemptible insect, who live by sucking human blood, I'd have borne a\ngood deal more than that for the satisfaction of dashing the life out\nof you!\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE ASS AND THE WOLF\n\n\nAn Ass was feeding in a meadow, and, catching sight of his enemy the\nWolf in the distance, pretended to be very lame and hobbled painfully\nalong. When the Wolf came up, he asked the Ass how he came to be so\nlame, and the Ass replied that in going through a hedge he had trodden\non a thorn, and he begged the Wolf to pull it out with his teeth, \"In\ncase,\" he said, \"when you eat me, it should stick in your throat and\nhurt you very much.\" The Wolf said he would, and told the Ass to lift\nup his foot, and gave his whole mind to getting out the thorn. But the\nAss suddenly let out with his heels and fetched the Wolf a fearful\nkick in the mouth, breaking his teeth; and then he galloped off at\nfull speed. As soon as he could speak the Wolf growled to himself,\n\"It serves me right: my father taught me to kill, and I ought to have\nstuck to that trade instead of attempting to cure.\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE MONKEY AND THE CAMEL\n\n\nAt a gathering of all the beasts the Monkey gave an exhibition of\ndancing and entertained the company vastly. There was great applause\nat the finish, which excited the envy of the Camel and made him desire\nto win the favour of the assembly by the same means. So he got up from\nhis place and began dancing, but he cut such a ridiculous figure as he\nplunged about, and made such a grotesque exhibition of his ungainly\nperson, that the beasts all fell upon him with ridicule and drove him\naway.\n\n\n\n\nTHE SICK MAN AND THE DOCTOR\n\n\nA Sick Man received a visit from his Doctor, who asked him how he was.\n\"Fairly well, Doctor,\" said he, \"but I find I sweat a great deal.\"\n\"Ah,\" said the Doctor, \"that's a good sign.\" On his next visit he\nasked the same question, and his patient replied, \"I'm much as usual,\nbut I've taken to having shivering fits, which leave me cold all\nover.\" \"Ah,\" said the Doctor, \"that's a good sign too.\" When he came\nthe third time and inquired as before about his patient's health, the\nSick Man said that he felt very feverish. \"A very good sign,\" said the\nDoctor; \"you are doing very nicely indeed.\" Afterwards a friend came\nto see the invalid, and on asking him how he did, received this reply:\n\"My dear friend, I'm dying of good signs.\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE TRAVELLERS AND THE PLANE-TREE\n\n\nTwo Travellers were walking along a bare and dusty road in the heat of\na summer's day. Coming presently to a Plane-tree, they joyfully turned\naside to shelter from the burning rays of the sun in the deep shade of\nits spreading branches. As they rested, looking up into the tree, one\nof them remarked to his companion, \"What a useless tree the Plane is!\nIt bears no fruit and is of no service to man at all.\" The Plane-tree\ninterrupted him with indignation. \"You ungrateful creature!\" it cried:\n\"you come and take shelter under me from the scorching sun, and then,\nin the very act of enjoying the cool shade of my foliage, you abuse me\nand call me good for nothing!\"\n\n    Many a service is met with ingratitude.\n\n\n\n\nTHE FLEA AND THE OX\n\n\nA Flea once said to an Ox, \"How comes it that a big strong fellow like\nyou is content to serve mankind, and do all their hard work for them,\nwhile I, who am no bigger than you see, live on their bodies and drink\nmy fill of their blood, and never do a stroke for it all?\" To which\nthe Ox replied, \"Men are very kind to me, and so I am grateful to\nthem: they feed and house me well, and every now and then they show\ntheir fondness for me by patting me on the head and neck.\" \"They'd pat\nme, too,\" said the Flea, \"if I let them: but I take good care they\ndon't, or there would be nothing left of me.\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE BIRDS, THE BEASTS, AND THE BAT\n\n\nThe Birds were at war with the Beasts, and many battles were fought\nwith varying success on either side. The Bat did not throw in his lot\ndefinitely with either party, but when things went well for the Birds\nhe was found fighting in their ranks; when, on the other hand, the\nBeasts got the upper hand, he was to be found among the Beasts. No one\npaid any attention to him while the war lasted: but when it was over,\nand peace was restored, neither the Birds nor the Beasts would have\nanything to do with so double-faced a traitor, and so he remains to\nthis day a solitary outcast from both.\n\n\n\n\nTHE MAN AND HIS TWO SWEETHEARTS\n\n\nA Man of middle age, whose hair was turning grey, had two Sweethearts,\nan old woman and a young one. The elder of the two didn't like having\na lover who looked so much younger than herself; so, whenever he came\nto see her, she used to pull the dark hairs out of his head to make\nhim look old. The younger, on the other hand, didn't like him to look\nso much older than herself, and took every opportunity of pulling out\nthe grey hairs, to make him look young. Between them, they left not a\nhair in his head, and he became perfectly bald.\n\n\n\n\nTHE EAGLE, THE JACKDAW, AND THE SHEPHERD\n\n\nOne day a Jackdaw saw an Eagle swoop down on a lamb and carry it off\nin its talons. \"My word,\" said the Jackdaw, \"I'll do that myself.\" So\nit flew high up into the air, and then came shooting down with a\ngreat whirring of wings on to the back of a big ram. It had no sooner\nalighted than its claws got caught fast in the wool, and nothing it\ncould do was of any use: there it stuck, flapping away, and only\nmaking things worse instead of better. By and by up came the Shepherd.\n\"Oho,\" he said, \"so that's what you'd be doing, is it?\" And he\ntook the Jackdaw, and clipped its wings and carried it home to his\nchildren. It looked so odd that they didn't know what to make of it.\n\"What sort of bird is it, father?\" they asked. \"It's a Jackdaw,\" he\nreplied, \"and nothing but a Jackdaw: but it wants to be taken for an\nEagle.\"\n\n    If you attempt what is beyond your power, your trouble will be\n    wasted and you court not only misfortune but ridicule.\n\n\n\n\nTHE WOLF AND THE BOY\n\n\nA Wolf, who had just enjoyed a good meal and was in a playful mood,\ncaught sight of a Boy lying flat upon the ground, and, realising that\nhe was trying to hide, and that it was fear of himself that made him\ndo this, he went up to him and said, \"Aha, I've found you, you see;\nbut if you can say three things to me, the truth of which cannot be\ndisputed, I will spare your life.\" The Boy plucked up courage and\nthought for a moment, and then he said, \"First, it is a pity you saw\nme; secondly, I was a fool to let myself be seen; and thirdly, we all\nhate wolves because they are always making unprovoked attacks upon our\nflocks.\" The Wolf replied, \"Well, what you say is true enough from\nyour point of view; so you may go.\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE MILLER, HIS SON, AND THEIR ASS\n\n\nA Miller, accompanied by his young Son, was driving his Ass to market\nin hopes of finding a purchaser for him. On the road they met a troop\nof girls, laughing and talking, who exclaimed, \"Did you ever see such\na pair of fools? To be trudging along the dusty road when they might\nbe riding!\" The Miller thought there was sense in what they said;\nso he made his Son mount the Ass, and himself walked at the side.\nPresently they met some of his old cronies, who greeted them and said,\n\"You'll spoil that Son of yours, letting him ride while you toil along\non foot! Make him walk, young lazybones! It'll do him all the good in\nthe world.\" The Miller followed their advice, and took his Son's place\non the back of the Ass while the boy trudged along behind. They had\nnot gone far when they overtook a party of women and children, and the\nMiller heard them say, \"What a selfish old man! He himself rides in\ncomfort, but lets his poor little boy follow as best he can on his own\nlegs!\" So he made his Son get up behind him. Further along the road\nthey met some travellers, who asked the Miller whether the Ass he was\nriding was his own property, or a beast hired for the occasion. He\nreplied that it was his own, and that he was taking it to market to\nsell. \"Good heavens!\" said they, \"with a load like that the poor beast\nwill be so exhausted by the time he gets there that no one will look\nat him. Why, you'd do better to carry him!\" \"Anything to please you,\"\nsaid the old man, \"we can but try.\" So they got off, tied the Ass's\nlegs together with a rope and slung him on a pole, and at last reached\nthe town, carrying him between them. This was so absurd a sight that\nthe people ran out in crowds to laugh at it, and chaffed the Father\nand Son unmercifully, some even calling them lunatics. They had then\ngot to a bridge over the river, where the Ass, frightened by the noise\nand his unusual situation, kicked and struggled till he broke the\nropes that bound him, and fell into the water and was drowned.\nWhereupon the unfortunate Miller, vexed and ashamed, made the best\nof his way home again, convinced that in trying to please all he had\npleased none, and had lost his Ass into the bargain.\n\n\n\n\nTHE STAG AND THE VINE\n\n\nA Stag, pursued by the huntsmen, concealed himself under cover of a\nthick Vine. They lost track of him and passed by his hiding-place\nwithout being aware that he was anywhere near. Supposing all danger to\nbe over, he presently began to browse on the leaves of the Vine. The\nmovement drew the attention of the returning huntsmen, and one of\nthem, supposing some animal to be hidden there, shot an arrow at a\nventure into the foliage. The unlucky Stag was pierced to the heart,\nand, as he expired, he said, \"I deserve my fate for my treachery in\nfeeding upon the leaves of my protector.\"\n\n    Ingratitude sometimes brings its own punishment.\n\n\n\n\nTHE LAMB CHASED BY A WOLF\n\n\nA Wolf was chasing a Lamb, which took refuge in a temple. The Wolf\nurged it to come out of the precincts, and said, \"If you don't, the\npriest is sure to catch you and offer you up in sacrifice on the\naltar.\" To which the Lamb replied, \"Thanks, I think I'll stay where I\nam: I'd rather be sacrificed any day than be eaten up by a Wolf.\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE ARCHER AND THE LION\n\n\nAn Archer went up into the hills to get some sport with his bow, and\nall the animals fled at the sight of him with the exception of the\nLion, who stayed behind and challenged him to fight. But he shot an\narrow at the Lion and hit him, and said, \"There, you see what my\nmessenger can do: just you wait a moment and I'll tackle you myself.\"\nThe Lion, however, when he felt the sting of the arrow, ran away as\nfast as his legs could carry him. A fox, who had seen it all happen,\nsaid to the Lion, \"Come, don't be a coward: why don't you stay and\nshow fight?\" But the Lion replied, \"You won't get me to stay, not you:\nwhy, when he sends a messenger like that before him, he must himself\nbe a terrible fellow to deal with.\"\n\n    Give a wide berth to those who can do damage at a distance.\n\n\n\n\nTHE WOLF AND THE GOAT\n\n\nA Wolf caught sight of a Goat browsing above him on the scanty herbage\nthat grew on the top of a steep rock; and being unable to get at her,\ntried to induce her to come lower down. \"You are risking your life up\nthere, madam, indeed you are,\" he called out: \"pray take my advice and\ncome down here, where you will find plenty of better food.\" The Goat\nturned a knowing eye upon him. \"It's little you care whether I get\ngood grass or bad,\" said she: \"what you want is to eat me.\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE SICK STAG\n\n\nA Stag fell sick and lay in a clearing in the forest, too weak to move\nfrom the spot. When the news of his illness spread, a number of the\nother beasts came to inquire after his health, and they one and all\nnibbled a little of the grass that grew round the invalid till at last\nthere was not a blade within his reach. In a few days he began to\nmend, but was still too feeble to get up and go in search of fodder;\nand thus he perished miserably of hunger owing to the thoughtlessness\nof his friends.\n\n\n\n\nTHE ASS AND THE MULE\n\n\nA certain man who had an Ass and a Mule loaded them both up one day\nand set out upon a journey. So long as the road was fairly level, the\nAss got on very well: but by and by they came to a place among the\nhills where the road was very rough and steep, and the Ass was at his\nlast gasp. So he begged the Mule to relieve him of a part of his load:\nbut the Mule refused. At last, from sheer weariness, the Ass stumbled\nand fell down a steep place and was killed. The driver was in despair,\nbut he did the best he could: he added the Ass's load to the Mule's,\nand he also flayed the Ass and put his skin on the top of the double\nload. The Mule could only just manage the extra weight, and, as he\nstaggered painfully along, he said to himself, \"I have only got what I\ndeserved: if I had been willing to help the Ass at first, I should not\nnow be carrying his load and his skin into the bargain.\"\n\n\n\n\nBROTHER AND SISTER\n\n\nA certain man had two children, a boy and a girl: and the boy was as\ngood-looking as the girl was plain. One day, as they were playing\ntogether in their mother's chamber, they chanced upon a mirror and saw\ntheir own features for the first time. The boy saw what a handsome\nfellow he was, and began to boast to his Sister about his good looks:\nshe, on her part, was ready to cry with vexation when she was aware of\nher plainness, and took his remarks as an insult to herself. Running\nto her father, she told him of her Brother's conceit, and accused him\nof meddling with his mother's things. He laughed and kissed them both,\nand said, \"My children, learn from now onwards to make a good use of\nthe glass. You, my boy, strive to be as good as it shows you to be\nhandsome; and you, my girl, resolve to make up for the plainness of\nyour features by the sweetness of your disposition.\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE HEIFER AND THE OX\n\n\nA Heifer went up to an Ox, who was straining hard at the plough,\nand sympathised with him in a rather patronising sort of way on the\nnecessity of his having to work so hard. Not long afterwards there was\na festival in the village and every one kept holiday: but, whereas the\nOx was turned loose into the pasture, the Heifer was seized and led\noff to sacrifice. \"Ah,\" said the Ox, with a grim smile, \"I see now why\nyou were allowed to have such an idle time: it was because you were\nalways intended for the altar.\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE KINGDOM OF THE LION\n\n\nWhen the Lion reigned over the beasts of the earth he was never cruel\nor tyrannical, but as gentle and just as a King ought to be. During\nhis reign he called a general assembly of the beasts, and drew up a\ncode of laws under which all were to live in perfect equality and\nharmony: the wolf and the lamb, the tiger and the stag, the leopard\nand the kid, the dog and the hare, all should dwell side by side in\nunbroken peace and friendship. The hare said, \"Oh! how I have longed\nfor this day when the weak take their place without fear by the side\nof the strong!\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE ASS AND HIS DRIVER\n\n\nAn Ass was being driven down a mountain road, and after jogging along\nfor a while sensibly enough he suddenly quitted the track and rushed\nto the edge of a precipice. He was just about to leap over the edge\nwhen his Driver caught hold of his tail and did his best to pull him\nback: but pull as he might he couldn't get the Ass to budge from the\nbrink. At last he gave up, crying, \"All right, then, get to the bottom\nyour own way; but it's the way to sudden death, as you'll find out\nquick enough.\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE LION AND THE HARE\n\n\nA Lion found a Hare sleeping in her form, and was just going to devour\nher when he caught sight of a passing stag. Dropping the Hare, he at\nonce made for the bigger game; but finding, after a long chase, that\nhe could not overtake the stag, he abandoned the attempt and came back\nfor the Hare. When he reached the spot, however, he found she was\nnowhere to be seen, and he had to go without his dinner. \"It serves\nme right,\" he said; \"I should have been content with what I had got,\ninstead of hankering after a better prize.\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE WOLVES AND THE DOGS\n\n\nOnce upon a time the Wolves said to the Dogs, \"Why should we continue\nto be enemies any longer? You are very like us in most ways: the main\ndifference between us is one of training only. We live a life of\nfreedom; but you are enslaved to mankind, who beat you, and put heavy\ncollars round your necks, and compel you to keep watch over their\nflocks and herds for them, and, to crown all, they give you nothing\nbut bones to eat. Don't put up with it any longer, but hand over the\nflocks to us, and we will all live on the fat of the land and feast\ntogether.\" The Dogs allowed themselves to be persuaded by these words,\nand accompanied the Wolves into their den. But no sooner were they\nwell inside than the Wolves set upon them and tore them to pieces.\n\n    Traitors richly deserve their fate.\n\n\n\n\nTHE BULL AND THE CALF\n\n\nA full-grown Bull was struggling to force his huge bulk through the\nnarrow entrance to a cow-house where his stall was, when a young Calf\ncame up and said to him, \"If you'll step aside a moment, I'll show you\nthe way to get through.\" The Bull turned upon him an amused look. \"I\nknew that way,\" said he, \"before you were born.\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE TREES AND THE AXE\n\n\nA Woodman went into the forest and begged of the Trees the favour of a\nhandle for his Axe. The principal Trees at once agreed to so modest a\nrequest, and unhesitatingly gave him a young ash sapling, out of which\nhe fashioned the handle he desired. No sooner had he done so than he\nset to work to fell the noblest Trees in the wood. When they saw the\nuse to which he was putting their gift, they cried, \"Alas! alas! We\nare undone, but we are ourselves to blame. The little we gave has\ncost us all: had we not sacrificed the rights of the ash, we might\nourselves have stood for ages.\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE ASTRONOMER\n\n\nThere was once an Astronomer whose habit it was to go out at night and\nobserve the stars. One night, as he was walking about outside the town\ngates, gazing up absorbed into the sky and not looking where he was\ngoing, he fell into a dry well. As he lay there groaning, some one\npassing by heard him, and, coming to the edge of the well, looked down\nand, on learning what had happened, said, \"If you really mean to say\nthat you were looking so hard at the sky that you didn't even see\nwhere your feet were carrying you along the ground, it appears to me\nthat you deserve all you've got.\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE LABOURER AND THE SNAKE\n\n\nA Labourer's little son was bitten by a Snake and died of the wound.\nThe father was beside himself with grief, and in his anger against\nthe Snake he caught up an axe and went and stood close to the Snake's\nhole, and watched for a chance of killing it. Presently the Snake came\nout, and the man aimed a blow at it, but only succeeded in cutting off\nthe tip of its tail before it wriggled in again. He then tried to get\nit to come out a second time, pretending that he wished to make up the\nquarrel. But the Snake said, \"I can never be your friend because of my\nlost tail, nor you mine because of your lost child.\"\n\n    Injuries are never forgotten in the presence of those who caused\n    them.\n\n\n\n\nTHE CAGE-BIRD AND THE BAT\n\n\nA Singing-bird was confined in a cage which hung outside a window, and\nhad a way of singing at night when all other birds were asleep. One\nnight a Bat came and clung to the bars of the cage, and asked the Bird\nwhy she was silent by day and sang only at night. \"I have a very good\nreason for doing so,\" said the Bird: \"it was once when I was singing\nin the daytime that a fowler was attracted by my voice, and set his\nnets for me and caught me. Since then I have never sung except by\nnight.\" But the Bat replied, \"It is no use your doing that now when\nyou are a prisoner: if only you had done so before you were caught,\nyou might still have been free.\"\n\n    Precautions are useless after the event.\n\n\n\n\nTHE ASS AND HIS PURCHASER\n\n\nA Man who wanted to buy an Ass went to market, and, coming across\na likely-looking beast, arranged with the owner that he should be\nallowed to take him home on trial to see what he was like. When he\nreached home, he put him into his stable along with the other asses.\nThe newcomer took a look round, and immediately went and chose a place\nnext to the laziest and greediest beast in the stable. When the master\nsaw this he put a halter on him at once, and led him off and handed\nhim over to his owner again. The latter was a good deal surprised to\nsee him back so soon, and said, \"Why, do you mean to say you have\ntested him already?\" \"I don't want to put him through any more tests,\"\nreplied the other: \"I could see what sort of beast he is from the\ncompanion he chose for himself.\"\n\n    A man is known by the company he keeps.\n\n\n\n\nTHE KID AND THE WOLF\n\n\nA Kid strayed from the flock and was chased by a Wolf. When he saw he\nmust be caught he turned round and said to the Wolf, \"I know, sir,\nthat I can't escape being eaten by you: and so, as my life is bound to\nbe short, I pray you let it be as merry as may be. Will you not play\nme a tune to dance to before I die?\" The Wolf saw no objection to\nhaving some music before his dinner: so he took out his pipe and began\nto play, while the Kid danced before him. Before many minutes were\npassed the gods who guarded the flock heard the sound and came up to\nsee what was going on. They no sooner clapped eyes on the Wolf than\nthey gave chase and drove him away. As he ran off, he turned and\nsaid to the Kid, \"It's what I thoroughly deserve: my trade is the\nbutcher's, and I had no business to turn piper to please you.\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE DEBTOR AND HIS SOW\n\n\nA Man of Athens fell into debt and was pressed for the money by his\ncreditor; but he had no means of paying at the time, so he begged for\ndelay. But the creditor refused and said he must pay at once. Then the\nDebtor fetched a Sow--the only one he had--and took her to market\nto offer her for sale. It happened that his creditor was there too.\nPresently a buyer came along and asked if the Sow produced good\nlitters. \"Yes,\" said the Debtor, \"very fine ones; and the remarkable\nthing is that she produces females at the Mysteries and males at the\nPanathenea.\" (Festivals these were: and the Athenians always sacrifice\na sow at one, and a boar at the other; while at the Dionysia they\nsacrifice a kid.) At that the creditor, who was standing by, put in,\n\"Don't be surprised, sir; why, still better, at the Dionysia this Sow\nhas kids!\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE BALD HUNTSMAN\n\n\nA Man who had lost all his hair took to wearing a wig, and one day\nhe went out hunting. It was blowing rather hard at the time, and he\nhadn't gone far before a gust of wind caught his hat and carried it\noff, and his wig too, much to the amusement of the hunt. But he quite\nentered into the joke, and said, \"Ah, well! the hair that wig is made\nof didn't stick to the head on which it grew; so it's no wonder it\nwon't stick to mine.\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE HERDSMAN AND THE LOST BULL\n\n\nA Herdsman was tending his cattle when he missed a young Bull, one of\nthe finest of the herd. He went at once to look for him, but, meeting\nwith no success in his search, he made a vow that, if he should\ndiscover the thief, he would sacrifice a calf to Jupiter. Continuing\nhis search, he entered a thicket, where he presently espied a lion\ndevouring the lost Bull. Terrified with fear, he raised his hands to\nheaven and cried, \"Great Jupiter, I vowed I would sacrifice a calf\nto thee if I should discover the thief: but now a full-grown Bull\nI promise thee if only I myself escape unhurt from his clutches.\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE MULE\n\n\nOne morning a Mule, who had too much to eat and too little to do,\nbegan to think himself a very fine fellow indeed, and frisked about\nsaying, \"My father was undoubtedly a high-spirited horse and I take\nafter him entirely.\" But very soon afterwards he was put into the\nharness and compelled to go a very long way with a heavy load behind\nhim. At the end of the day, exhausted by his unusual exertions, he\nsaid dejectedly to himself, \"I must have been mistaken about my\nfather; he can only have been an ass after all.\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE HOUND AND THE FOX\n\n\nA Hound, roaming in the forest, spied a lion, and being well used\nto lesser game, gave chase, thinking he would make a fine quarry.\nPresently the lion perceived that he was being pursued; so, stopping\nshort, he rounded on his pursuer and gave a loud roar. The Hound\nimmediately turned tail and fled. A Fox, seeing him running away,\njeered at him and said, \"Ho! ho! There goes the coward who chased a\nlion and ran away the moment he roared!\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE FATHER AND HIS DAUGHTERS\n\n\nA Man had two Daughters, one of whom he gave in marriage to a\ngardener, and the other to a potter. After a time he thought he\nwould go and see how they were getting on; and first he went to the\ngardener's wife. He asked her how she was, and how things were going\nwith herself and her husband. She replied that on the whole they were\ndoing very well: \"But,\" she continued, \"I do wish we could have some\ngood heavy rain: the garden wants it badly.\" Then he went on to the\npotter's wife and made the same inquiries of her. She replied that she\nand her husband had nothing to complain of: \"But,\" she went on, \"I do\nwish we could have some nice dry weather, to dry the pottery.\" Her\nFather looked at her with a humorous expression on his face. \"You want\ndry weather,\" he said, \"and your sister wants rain. I was going to ask\nin my prayers that your wishes should be granted; but now it strikes\nme I had better not refer to the subject.\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE THIEF AND THE INNKEEPER\n\n\nA Thief hired a room at an inn, and stayed there some days on the\nlook-out for something to steal. No opportunity, however, presented\nitself, till one day, when there was a festival to be celebrated, the\nInnkeeper appeared in a fine new coat and sat down before the door of\nthe inn for an airing. The Thief no sooner set eyes upon the coat than\nhe longed to get possession of it. There was no business doing, so he\nwent and took a seat by the side of the Innkeeper, and began talking\nto him. They conversed together for some time, and then the Thief\nsuddenly yawned and howled like a wolf. The Innkeeper asked him in\nsome concern what ailed him. The Thief replied, \"I will tell you about\nmyself, sir, but first I must beg you to take charge of my clothes\nfor me, for I intend to leave them with you. Why I have these fits\nof yawning I cannot tell: maybe they are sent as a punishment for my\nmisdeeds; but, whatever the reason, the facts are that when I have\nyawned three times I become a ravening wolf and fly at men's throats.\"\nAs he finished speaking he yawned a second time and howled again as\nbefore. The Innkeeper, believing every word he said, and terrified\nat the prospect of being confronted with a wolf, got up hastily and\nstarted to run indoors; but the Thief caught him by the coat and tried\nto stop him, crying, \"Stay, sir, stay, and take charge of my clothes,\nor else I shall never see them again.\" As he spoke he opened his mouth\nand began to yawn for the third time. The Innkeeper, mad with the fear\nof being eaten by a wolf, slipped out of his coat, which remained in\nthe other's hands, and bolted into the inn and locked the door behind\nhim; and the Thief then quietly stole off with his spoil.\n\n\n\n\nTHE PACK-ASS AND THE WILD ASS\n\n\nA Wild Ass, who was wandering idly about, one day came upon a Pack-Ass\nlying at full length in a sunny spot and thoroughly enjoying himself.\nGoing up to him, he said, \"What a lucky beast you are! Your sleek coat\nshows how well you live: how I envy you!\" Not long after the Wild Ass\nsaw his acquaintance again, but this time he was carrying a heavy\nload, and his driver was following behind and beating him with a thick\nstick. \"Ah, my friend,\" said the Wild Ass, \"I don't envy you any more:\nfor I see you pay dear for your comforts.\"\n\n    Advantages that are dearly bought are doubtful blessings.\n\n\n\n\nTHE ASS AND HIS MASTERS\n\n\nA Gardener had an Ass which had a very hard time of it, what with\nscanty food, heavy loads, and constant beating. The Ass therefore\nbegged Jupiter to take him away from the Gardener and hand him over\nto another master. So Jupiter sent Mercury to the Gardener to bid\nhim sell the Ass to a Potter, which he did. But the Ass was as\ndiscontented as ever, for he had to work harder than before: so he\nbegged Jupiter for relief a second time, and Jupiter very obligingly\narranged that he should be sold to a Tanner. But when the Ass saw what\nhis new master's trade was, he cried in despair, \"Why wasn't I content\nto serve either of my former masters, hard as I had to work and badly\nas I was treated? for they would have buried me decently, but now I\nshall come in the end to the tanning-vat.\"\n\n    Servants don't know a good master till they have served a worse.\n\n\n\n\nTHE PACK-ASS, THE WILD ASS, AND THE LION\n\n\nA Wild Ass saw a Pack-Ass jogging along under a heavy load, and\ntaunted him with the condition of slavery in which he lived, in these\nwords: \"What a vile lot is yours compared with mine! I am free as the\nair, and never do a stroke of work; and, as for fodder, I have only to\ngo to the hills and there I find far more than enough for my needs.\nBut you! you depend on your master for food, and he makes you carry\nheavy loads every day and beats you unmercifully.\" At that moment a\nLion appeared on the scene, and made no attempt to molest the Pack-Ass\nowing to the presence of the driver; but he fell upon the Wild Ass,\nwho had no one to protect him, and without more ado made a meal of\nhim.\n\n    It is no use being your own master unless you can stand up for\n    yourself.\n\n\n\n\nTHE ANT\n\n\nAnts were once men and made their living by tilling the soil. But, not\ncontent with the results of their own work, they were always casting\nlonging eyes upon the crops and fruits of their neighbours, which they\nstole, whenever they got the chance, and added to their own store. At\nlast their covetousness made Jupiter so angry that he changed them\ninto Ants. But, though their forms were changed, their nature remained\nthe same: and so, to this day, they go about among the cornfields and\ngather the fruits of others' labour, and store them up for their own\nuse.\n\n    You may punish a thief, but his bent remains.\n\n\n\n\nTHE FROGS AND THE WELL\n\n\nTwo Frogs lived together in a marsh. But one hot summer the marsh\ndried up, and they left it to look for another place to live in: for\nfrogs like damp places if they can get them. By and by they came to a\ndeep well, and one of them looked down into it, and said to the other,\n\"This looks a nice cool place: let us jump in and settle here.\" But\nthe other, who had a wiser head on his shoulders, replied, \"Not so\nfast, my friend: supposing this well dried up like the marsh, how\nshould we get out again?\"\n\n    Think twice before you act.\n\n\n\n\nTHE CRAB AND THE FOX\n\n\nA Crab once left the sea-shore and went and settled in a meadow some\nway inland, which looked very nice and green and seemed likely to be a\ngood place to feed in. But a hungry Fox came along and spied the Crab\nand caught him. Just as he was going to be eaten up, the Crab said,\n\"This is just what I deserve; for I had no business to leave my\nnatural home by the sea and settle here as though I belonged to the\nland.\"\n\n    Be content with your lot.\n\n\n\n\nTHE FOX AND THE GRASSHOPPER\n\n\nA Grasshopper sat chirping in the branches of a tree. A Fox heard her,\nand, thinking what a dainty morsel she would make, he tried to get her\ndown by a trick. Standing below in full view of her, he praised her\nsong in the most flattering terms, and begged her to descend, saying\nhe would like to make the acquaintance of the owner of so beautiful a\nvoice. But she was not to be taken in, and replied, \"You are very much\nmistaken, my dear sir, if you imagine I am going to come down: I keep\nwell out of the way of you and your kind ever since the day when I saw\nnumbers of grasshoppers' wings strewn about the entrance to a fox's\nearth.\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE FARMER, HIS BOY, AND THE ROOKS\n\n\nA Farmer had just sown a field of wheat, and was keeping a careful\nwatch over it, for numbers of Rooks and starlings kept continually\nsettling on it and eating up the grain. Along with him went his Boy,\ncarrying a sling: and whenever the Farmer asked for the sling the\nstarlings understood what he said and warned the Rooks and they were\noff in a moment. So the Farmer hit on a trick. \"My lad,\" said he, \"we\nmust get the better of these birds somehow. After this, when I want\nthe sling, I won't say 'sling,' but just 'humph!' and you must then\nhand me the sling quickly.\" Presently back came the whole flock.\n\"Humph!\" said the Farmer; but the starlings took no notice, and he\nhad time to sling several stones among them, hitting one on the head,\nanother in the legs, and another in the wing, before they got out of\nrange. As they made all haste away they met some cranes, who asked\nthem what the matter was. \"Matter?\" said one of the Rooks; \"it's those\nrascals, men, that are the matter. Don't you go near them. They have\na way of saying one thing and meaning another which has just been the\ndeath of several of our poor friends.\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE ASS AND THE DOG\n\n\nAn Ass and a Dog were on their travels together, and, as they went\nalong, they found a sealed packet lying on the ground. The Ass picked\nit up, broke the seal, and found it contained some writing, which he\nproceeded to read out aloud to the Dog. As he read on it turned out\nto be all about grass and barley and hay--in short, all the kinds of\nfodder that Asses are fond of. The Dog was a good deal bored with\nlistening to all this, till at last his impatience got the better of\nhim, and he cried, \"Just skip a few pages, friend, and see if there\nisn't something about meat and bones.\" The Ass glanced all through the\npacket, but found nothing of the sort, and said so. Then the Dog said\nin disgust, \"Oh, throw it away, do: what's the good of a thing like\nthat?\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE ASS CARRYING THE IMAGE\n\n\nA certain man put an Image on the back of his Ass to take it to one of\nthe temples of the town. As they went along the road all the people\nthey met uncovered and bowed their heads out of reverence for the\nImage; but the Ass thought they were doing it out of respect for\nhimself, and began to give himself airs accordingly. At last he became\nso conceited that he imagined he could do as he liked, and, by way of\nprotest against the load he was carrying, he came to a full stop and\nflatly declined to proceed any further. His driver, finding him so\nobstinate, hit him hard and long with his stick, saying the while,\n\"Oh, you dunder-headed idiot, do you suppose it's come to this, that\nmen pay worship to an Ass?\"\n\n    Rude shocks await those who take to themselves the credit that is\n    due to others.\n\n\n\n\nTHE ATHENIAN AND THE THEBAN\n\n\nAn Athenian and a Theban were on the road together, and passed the\ntime in conversation, as is the way of travellers. After discussing\na variety of subjects they began to talk about heroes, a topic that\ntends to be more fertile than edifying. Each of them was lavish in his\npraises of the heroes of his own city, until eventually the Theban\nasserted that Hercules was the greatest hero who had ever lived on\nearth, and now occupied a foremost place among the gods; while the\nAthenian insisted that Theseus was far superior, for his fortune had\nbeen in every way supremely blessed, whereas Hercules had at one time\nbeen forced to act as a servant. And he gained his point, for he was a\nvery glib fellow, like all Athenians; so that the Theban, who was no\nmatch for him in talking, cried at last in some disgust, \"All right,\nhave your way; I only hope that, when our heroes are angry with us,\nAthens may suffer from the anger of Hercules, and Thebes only from\nthat of Theseus.\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE GOATHERD AND THE GOAT\n\n\nA Goatherd was one day gathering his flock to return to the fold, when\none of his goats strayed and refused to join the rest. He tried for a\nlong time to get her to return by calling and whistling to her, but\nthe Goat took no notice of him at all; so at last he threw a stone at\nher and broke one of her horns. In dismay, he begged her not to tell\nhis master: but she replied, \"You silly fellow, my horn would cry\naloud even if I held my tongue.\"\n\n    It's no use trying to hide what can't be hidden.\n\n\n\n\nTHE SHEEP AND THE DOG\n\n\nOnce upon a time the Sheep complained to the shepherd about the\ndifference in his treatment of themselves and his Dog. \"Your conduct,\"\nsaid they, \"is very strange and, we think, very unfair. We provide you\nwith wool and lambs and milk and you give us nothing but grass, and\neven that we have to find for ourselves: but you get nothing at all\nfrom the Dog, and yet you feed him with tit-bits from your own table.\"\nTheir remarks were overheard by the Dog, who spoke up at once and\nsaid, \"Yes, and quite right, too: where would you be if it wasn't for\nme? Thieves would steal you! Wolves would eat you! Indeed, if I didn't\nkeep constant watch over you, you would be too terrified even to\ngraze!\" The Sheep were obliged to acknowledge that he spoke the truth,\nand never again made a grievance of the regard in which he was held by\nhis master.\n\n\n\n\nTHE SHEPHERD AND THE WOLF\n\n\nA Shepherd found a Wolf's Cub straying in the pastures, and took him\nhome and reared him along with his dogs. When the Cub grew to his full\nsize, if ever a wolf stole a sheep from the flock, he used to join the\ndogs in hunting him down. It sometimes happened that the dogs failed\nto come up with the thief, and, abandoning the pursuit, returned home.\nThe Wolf would on such occasions continue the chase by himself, and\nwhen he overtook the culprit, would stop and share the feast with him,\nand then return to the Shepherd. But if some time passed without a\nsheep being carried off by the wolves, he would steal one himself\nand share his plunder with the dogs. The Shepherd's suspicions were\naroused, and one day he caught him in the act; and, fastening a rope\nround his neck, hung him on the nearest tree.\n\n    What's bred in the bone is sure to come out in the flesh.\n\n\n\n\nTHE LION, JUPITER, AND THE ELEPHANT\n\n\nThe Lion, for all his size and strength, and his sharp teeth and\nclaws, is a coward in one thing: he can't bear the sound of a cock\ncrowing, and runs away whenever he hears it. He complained bitterly\nto Jupiter for making him like that; but Jupiter said it wasn't his\nfault: he had done the best he could for him, and, considering this\nwas his only failing, he ought to be well content. The Lion, however,\nwouldn't be comforted, and was so ashamed of his timidity that he\nwished he might die. In this state of mind, he met the Elephant and\nhad a talk with him. He noticed that the great beast cocked up his\nears all the time, as if he were listening for something, and he asked\nhim why he did so. Just then a gnat came humming by, and the Elephant\nsaid, \"Do you see that wretched little buzzing insect? I'm terribly\nafraid of its getting into my ear: if it once gets in, I'm dead and\ndone for.\" The Lion's spirits rose at once when he heard this: \"For,\"\nhe said to himself, \"if the Elephant, huge as he is, is afraid of a\ngnat, I needn't be so much ashamed of being afraid of a cock, who is\nten thousand times bigger than a gnat.\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE PIG AND THE SHEEP\n\n\nA Pig found his way into a meadow where a flock of Sheep were grazing.\nThe shepherd caught him, and was proceeding to carry him off to the\nbutcher's when he set up a loud squealing and struggled to get free.\nThe Sheep rebuked him for making such a to-do, and said to him, \"The\nshepherd catches us regularly and drags us off just like that, and we\ndon't make any fuss.\" \"No, I dare say not,\" replied the Pig, \"but my\ncase and yours are altogether different: he only wants you for wool,\nbut he wants me for bacon.\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE GARDENER AND HIS DOG\n\n\nA Gardner's Dog fell into a deep well, from which his master used to\ndraw water for the plants in his garden with a rope and a bucket.\nFailing to get the Dog out by means of these, the Gardener went down\ninto the well himself in order to fetch him up. But the Dog thought he\nhad come to make sure of drowning him; so he bit his master as soon as\nhe came within reach, and hurt him a good deal, with the result that\nhe left the Dog to his fate and climbed out of the well, remarking,\n\"It serves me quite right for trying to save so determined a suicide.\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE RIVERS AND THE SEA\n\n\nOnce upon a time all the Rivers combined to protest against the action\nof the Sea in making their waters salt. \"When we come to you,\" said\nthey to the Sea, \"we are sweet and drinkable: but when once we have\nmingled with you, our waters become as briny and unpalatable as your\nown.\" The Sea replied shortly, \"Keep away from me and you'll remain\nsweet.\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE LION IN LOVE\n\n\nA Lion fell deeply in love with the daughter of a cottager and wanted\nto marry her; but her father was unwilling to give her to so fearsome\na husband, and yet didn't want to offend the Lion; so he hit upon the\nfollowing expedient. He went to the Lion and said, \"I think you will\nmake a very good husband for my daughter: but I cannot consent to your\nunion unless you let me draw your teeth and pare your nails, for my\ndaughter is terribly afraid of them.\" The Lion was so much in love\nthat he readily agreed that this should be done. When once, however,\nhe was thus disarmed, the Cottager was afraid of him no longer, but\ndrove him away with his club.\n\n\n\n\nTHE BEE-KEEPER\n\n\nA Thief found his way into an apiary when the Bee-keeper was away,\nand stole all the honey. When the Keeper returned and found the hives\nempty, he was very much upset and stood staring at them for some time.\nBefore long the bees came back from gathering honey, and, finding\ntheir hives overturned and the Keeper standing by, they made for him\nwith their stings. At this he fell into a passion and cried, \"You\nungrateful scoundrels, you let the thief who stole my honey get off\nscot-free, and then you go and sting me who have always taken such\ncare of you!\"\n\n    When you hit back make sure you have got the right man.\n\n\n\n\nTHE WOLF AND THE HORSE\n\n\nA Wolf on his rambles came to a field of oats, but, not being able to\neat them, he was passing on his way when a Horse came along. \"Look,\"\nsaid the Wolf, \"here's a fine field of oats. For your sake I have\nleft it untouched, and I shall greatly enjoy the sound of your teeth\nmunching the ripe grain.\" But the Horse replied, \"If wolves could eat\noats, my fine friend, you would hardly have indulged your ears at the\ncost of your belly.\"\n\n    There is no virtue in giving to others what is useless to oneself.\n\n\n\n\nTHE BAT, THE BRAMBLE, AND THE SEAGULL\n\n\nA Bat, a Bramble, and a Seagull went into partnership and determined\nto go on a trading voyage together. The Bat borrowed a sum of money\nfor his venture; the Bramble laid in a stock of clothes of various\nkinds; and the Seagull took a quantity of lead: and so they set out.\nBy and by a great storm came on, and their boat with all the cargo\nwent to the bottom, but the three travellers managed to reach land.\nEver since then the Seagull flies to and fro over the sea, and every\nnow and then dives below the surface, looking for the lead he's lost;\nwhile the Bat is so afraid of meeting his creditors that he hides away\nby day and only comes out at night to feed; and the Bramble catches\nhold of the clothes of every one who passes by, hoping some day to\nrecognise and recover the lost garments.\n\n    All men are more concerned to recover what they lose than to\n    acquire what they lack.\n\n\n\n\nTHE DOG AND THE WOLF\n\n\nA Dog was lying in the sun before a farmyard gate when a Wolf pounced\nupon him and was just going to eat him up; but he begged for his life\nand said, \"You see how thin I am and what a wretched meal I should\nmake you now: but if you will only wait a few days my master is going\nto give a feast. All the rich scraps and pickings will fall to me and\nI shall get nice and fat: then will be the time for you to eat me.\"\nThe Wolf thought this was a very good plan and went away. Some time\nafterwards he came to the farmyard again, and found the Dog lying out\nof reach on the stable roof. \"Come down,\" he called, \"and be eaten:\nyou remember our agreement?\" But the Dog said coolly, \"My friend, if\never you catch me lying down by the gate there again, don't you wait\nfor any feast.\"\n\n    Once bitten, twice shy.\n\n\n\n\nTHE WASP AND THE SNAKE\n\n\nA Wasp settled on the head of a Snake, and not only stung him several\ntimes, but clung obstinately to the head of his victim. Maddened with\npain the Snake tried every means he could think of to get rid of\nthe creature, but without success. At last he became desperate, and\ncrying, \"Kill you I will, even at the cost of my own life,\" he laid\nhis head with the Wasp on it under the wheel of a passing waggon, and\nthey both perished together.\n\n\n\n\nTHE EAGLE AND THE BEETLE\n\n\nAn Eagle was chasing a hare, which was running for dear life and was\nat her wits' end to know where to turn for help. Presently she espied\na Beetle, and begged it to aid her. So when the Eagle came up\nthe Beetle warned her not to touch the hare, which was under its\nprotection. But the Eagle never noticed the Beetle because it was so\nsmall, seized the hare and ate her up. The Beetle never forgot this,\nand used to keep an eye on the Eagle's nest, and whenever the Eagle\nlaid an egg it climbed up and rolled it out of the nest and broke it.\nAt last the Eagle got so worried over the loss of her eggs that she\nwent up to Jupiter, who is the special protector of Eagles, and begged\nhim to give her a safe place to nest in: so he let her lay her eggs in\nhis lap. But the Beetle noticed this and made a ball of dirt the size\nof an Eagle's egg, and flew up and deposited it in Jupiter's lap. When\nJupiter saw the dirt, he stood up to shake it out of his robe, and,\nforgetting about the eggs, he shook them out too, and they were broken\njust as before. Ever since then, they say, Eagles never lay their eggs\nat the season when Beetles are about.\n\n    The weak will sometimes find ways to avenge an insult, even upon\n    the strong.\n\n\n\n\nTHE FOWLER AND THE LARK\n\n\nA Fowler was setting his nets for little birds when a Lark came up\nto him and asked him what he was doing. \"I am engaged in founding a\ncity,\" said he, and with that he withdrew to a short distance and\nconcealed himself. The Lark examined the nets with great curiosity,\nand presently, catching sight of the bait, hopped on to them in order\nto secure it, and became entangled in the meshes. The Fowler then ran\nup quickly and captured her. \"What a fool I was!\" said she: \"but at\nany rate, if that's the kind of city you are founding, it'll be a long\ntime before you find fools enough to fill it.\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE FISHERMAN PIPING\n\n\nA Fisherman who could play the flute went down one day to the\nsea-shore with his nets and his flute; and, taking his stand on a\nprojecting rock, began to play a tune, thinking that the music would\nbring the fish jumping out of the sea. He went on playing for some\ntime, but not a fish appeared: so at last he threw down his flute and\ncast his net into the sea, and made a great haul of fish. When they\nwere landed and he saw them leaping about on the shore, he cried, \"You\nrascals! you wouldn't dance when I piped: but now I've stopped, you\ncan do nothing else!\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE WEASEL AND THE MAN\n\n\nA Man once caught a Weasel, which was always sneaking about the house,\nand was just going to drown it in a tub of water, when it begged hard\nfor its life, and said to him, \"Surely you haven't the heart to put me\nto death? Think how useful I have been in clearing your house of the\nmice and lizards which used to infest it, and show your gratitude by\nsparing my life.\" \"You have not been altogether useless, I grant you,\"\nsaid the Man: \"but who killed the fowls? Who stole the meat? No, no!\nYou do much more harm than good, and die you shall.\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE PLOUGHMAN, THE ASS, AND THE OX\n\n\nA Ploughman yoked his Ox and his Ass together, and set to work to\nplough his field. It was a poor makeshift of a team, but it was the\nbest he could do, as he had but a single Ox. At the end of the day,\nwhen the beasts were loosed from the yoke, the Ass said to the Ox,\n\"Well, we've had a hard day: which of us is to carry the master home?\"\nThe Ox looked surprised at the question. \"Why,\" said he, \"you, to be\nsure, as usual.\"\n\n\n\n\nDEMADES AND HIS FABLE\n\n\nDemades the orator was once speaking in the Assembly at Athens; but\nthe people were very inattentive to what he was saying, so he stopped\nand said, \"Gentlemen, I should like to tell you one of Æsop's fables.\"\nThis made every one listen intently. Then Demades began: \"Demeter, a\nSwallow, and an Eel were once travelling together, and came to a river\nwithout a bridge: the Swallow flew over it, and the Eel swam across\";\nand then he stopped. \"What happened to Demeter?\" cried several people\nin the audience. \"Demeter,\" he replied, \"is very angry with you for\nlistening to fables when you ought to be minding public business.\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE MONKEY AND THE DOLPHIN\n\n\nWhen people go on a voyage they often take with them lap-dogs or\nmonkeys as pets to wile away the time. Thus it fell out that a man\nreturning to Athens from the East had a pet Monkey on board with him.\nAs they neared the coast of Attica a great storm burst upon them, and\nthe ship capsized. All on board were thrown into the water, and tried\nto save themselves by swimming, the Monkey among the rest. A Dolphin\nsaw him, and, supposing him to be a man, took him on his back and\nbegan swimming towards the shore. When they got near the Piræus, which\nis the port of Athens, the Dolphin asked the Monkey if he was an\nAthenian. The Monkey replied that he was, and added that he came of\na very distinguished family. \"Then, of course, you know the Piræus,\"\ncontinued the Dolphin. The Monkey thought he was referring to some\nhigh official or other, and replied, \"Oh, yes, he's a very old friend\nof mine.\" At that, detecting his hypocrisy, the Dolphin was so\ndisgusted that he dived below the surface, and the unfortunate Monkey\nwas quickly drowned.\n\n\n\n\nTHE CROW AND THE SNAKE\n\n\nA hungry Crow spied a Snake lying asleep in a sunny spot, and, picking\nit up in his claws, he was carrying it off to a place where he could\nmake a meal of it without being disturbed, when the Snake reared its\nhead and bit him. It was a poisonous Snake, and the bite was fatal,\nand the dying Crow said, \"What a cruel fate is mine! I thought I had\nmade a lucky find, and it has cost me my life!\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE DOGS AND THE FOX\n\n\nSome Dogs once found a lion's skin, and were worrying it with their\nteeth. Just then a Fox came by, and said, \"You think yourselves very\nbrave, no doubt; but if that were a live lion you'd find his claws a\ngood deal sharper than your teeth.\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE NIGHTINGALE AND THE HAWK\n\n\nA Nightingale was sitting on a bough of an oak and singing, as her\ncustom was. A hungry Hawk presently spied her, and darting to the spot\nseized her in his talons. He was just about to tear her in pieces when\nshe begged him to spare her life: \"I'm not big enough,\" she pleaded,\n\"to make you a good meal: you ought to seek your prey among the bigger\nbirds.\" The Hawk eyed her with some contempt. \"You must think me very\nsimple,\" said he, \"if you suppose I am going to give up a certain\nprize on the chance of a better of which I see at present no signs.\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE ROSE AND THE AMARANTH\n\n\nA Rose and an Amaranth blossomed side by side in a garden, and the\nAmaranth said to her neighbour, \"How I envy you your beauty and your\nsweet scent! No wonder you are such a universal favourite.\" But the\nRose replied with a shade of sadness in her voice, \"Ah, my dear\nfriend, I bloom but for a time: my petals soon wither and fall, and\nthen I die. But your flowers never fade, even if they are cut; for\nthey are everlasting.\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE MAN, THE HORSE, THE OX, AND THE DOG\n\n\nOne winter's day, during a severe storm, a Horse, an Ox, and a Dog\ncame and begged for shelter in the house of a Man. He readily admitted\nthem, and, as they were cold and wet, he lit a fire for their comfort:\nand he put oats before the Horse, and hay before the Ox, while he fed\nthe Dog with the remains of his own dinner. When the storm abated, and\nthey were about to depart, they determined to show their gratitude in\nthe following way. They divided the life of Man among them, and each\nendowed one part of it with the qualities which were peculiarly his\nown. The Horse took youth, and hence young men are high-mettled and\nimpatient of restraint; the Ox took middle age, and accordingly men in\nmiddle life are steady and hard-working; while the Dog took old age,\nwhich is the reason why old men are so often peevish and ill-tempered,\nand, like dogs, attached chiefly to those who look to their comfort,\nwhile they are disposed to snap at those who are unfamiliar or\ndistasteful to them.\n\n\n\n\nTHE WOLVES, THE SHEEP, AND THE RAM\n\n\nThe Wolves sent a deputation to the Sheep with proposals for a lasting\npeace between them, on condition of their giving up the sheep-dogs to\ninstant death. The foolish Sheep agreed to the terms; but an old Ram,\nwhose years had brought him wisdom, interfered and said, \"How can we\nexpect to live at peace with you? Why, even with the dogs at hand to\nprotect us, we are never secure from your murderous attacks!\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE SWAN\n\n\nThe Swan is said to sing but once in its life--when it knows that it\nis about to die. A certain man, who had heard of the song of the Swan,\none day saw one of these birds for sale in the market, and bought it\nand took it home with him. A few days later he had some friends\nto dinner, and produced the Swan, and bade it sing for their\nentertainment: but the Swan remained silent. In course of time, when\nit was growing old, it became aware of its approaching end and broke\ninto a sweet, sad song. When its owner heard it, he said angrily, \"If\nthe creature only sings when it is about to die, what a fool I was\nthat day I wanted to hear its song! I ought to have wrung its neck\ninstead of merely inviting it to sing.\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE SNAKE AND JUPITER\n\n\nA Snake suffered a good deal from being constantly trodden upon by man\nand beast, owing partly to the length of his body and partly to his\nbeing unable to raise himself above the surface of the ground: so\nhe went and complained to Jupiter about the risks to which he was\nexposed. But Jupiter had little sympathy for him. \"I dare say,\" said\nhe, \"that if you had bitten the first that trod on you, the others\nwould have taken more trouble to look where they put their feet.\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE WOLF AND HIS SHADOW\n\n\nA Wolf, who was roaming about on the plain when the sun was getting\nlow in the sky, was much impressed by the size of his shadow, and said\nto himself, \"I had no idea I was so big. Fancy my being afraid of a\nlion! Why, I, not he, ought to be King of the beasts\"; and, heedless\nof danger, he strutted about as if there could be no doubt at all\nabout it. Just then a lion sprang upon him and began to devour him.\n\"Alas,\" he cried, \"had I not lost sight of the facts, I shouldn't have\nbeen ruined by my fancies.\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE PLOUGHMAN AND THE WOLF\n\n\nA Ploughman loosed his oxen from the plough, and led them away to the\nwater to drink. While he was absent a half-starved Wolf appeared on\nthe scene, and went up to the plough and began chewing the leather\nstraps attached to the yoke. As he gnawed away desperately in the hope\nof satisfying his craving for food, he somehow got entangled in the\nharness, and, taking fright, struggled to get free, tugging at the\ntraces as if he would drag the plough along with him. Just then the\nPloughman came back, and seeing what was happening, he cried, \"Ah, you\nold rascal, I wish you would give up thieving for good and take to\nhonest work instead.\"\n\n\n\n\nMERCURY AND THE MAN BITTEN BY AN ANT\n\n\nA Man once saw a ship go down with all its crew, and commented\nseverely on the injustice of the gods. \"They care nothing for a man's\ncharacter,\" said he, \"but let the good and the bad go to their deaths\ntogether.\" There was an ant-heap close by where he was standing, and,\njust as he spoke, he was bitten in the foot by an Ant. Turning in a\ntemper to the ant-heap he stamped upon it and crushed hundreds of\nunoffending ants. Suddenly Mercury appeared, and belaboured him with\nhis staff, saying as he did so, \"You villain, where's your nice sense\nof justice now?\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE WILY LION\n\n\nA Lion watched a fat Bull feeding in a meadow, and his mouth watered\nwhen he thought of the royal feast he would make, but he did not dare\nto attack him, for he was afraid of his sharp horns. Hunger, however,\npresently compelled him to do something: and as the use of force did\nnot promise success, he determined to resort to artifice. Going up to\nthe Bull in friendly fashion, he said to him, \"I cannot help saying\nhow much I admire your magnificent figure. What a fine head! What\npowerful shoulders and thighs! But, my dear friend, what in the world\nmakes you wear those ugly horns? You must find them as awkward as they\nare unsightly. Believe me, you would do much better without them.\" The\nBull was foolish enough to be persuaded by this flattery to have his\nhorns cut off; and, having now lost his only means of defence, fell an\neasy prey to the Lion.\n\n\n\n\nTHE PARROT AND THE CAT\n\n\nA Man once bought a Parrot and gave it the run of his house. It\nrevelled in its liberty, and presently flew up on to the mantelpiece\nand screamed away to its heart's content. The noise disturbed the Cat,\nwho was asleep on the hearthrug. Looking up at the intruder, she said,\n\"Who may you be, and where have you come from?\" The Parrot replied,\n\"Your master has just bought me and brought me home with him.\" \"You\nimpudent bird,\" said the Cat, \"how dare you, a newcomer, make a noise\nlike that? Why, I was born here, and have lived here all my life, and\nyet, if I venture to mew, they throw things at me and chase me all\nover the place.\" \"Look here, mistress,\" said the Parrot, \"you just\nhold your tongue. My voice they delight in; but yours--yours is a\nperfect nuisance.\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE STAG AND THE LION\n\n\nA Stag was chased by the hounds, and took refuge in a cave, where he\nhoped to be safe from his pursuers. Unfortunately the cave contained a\nLion, to whom he fell an easy prey. \"Unhappy that I am,\" he cried, \"I\nam saved from the power of the dogs only to fall into the clutches of\na Lion.\"\n\n    Out of the frying-pan into the fire.\n\n\n\n\nTHE IMPOSTOR\n\n\nA certain man fell ill, and, being in a very bad way, he made a vow\nthat he would sacrifice a hundred oxen to the gods if they would grant\nhim a return to health. Wishing to see how he would keep his vow, they\ncaused him to recover in a short time. Now, he hadn't an ox in the\nworld, so he made a hundred little oxen out of tallow and offered\nthem up on an altar, at the same time saying, \"Ye gods, I call you to\nwitness that I have discharged my vow.\" The gods determined to be even\nwith him, so they sent him a dream, in which he was bidden to go to\nthe sea-shore and fetch a hundred crowns which he was to find there.\nHastening in great excitement to the shore, he fell in with a band of\nrobbers, who seized him and carried him off to sell as a slave: and\nwhen they sold him a hundred crowns was the sum he fetched.\n\n    Do not promise more than you can perform.\n\n\n\n\nTHE DOGS AND THE HIDES\n\n\nOnce upon a time a number of Dogs, who were famished with hunger, saw\nsome Hides steeping in a river, but couldn't get at them because the\nwater was too deep. So they put their heads together, and decided to\ndrink away at the river till it was shallow enough for them to reach\nthe Hides. But long before that happened they burst themselves with\ndrinking.\n\n\n\n\nTHE LION, THE FOX, AND THE ASS\n\n\nA Lion, a Fox, and an Ass went out hunting together. They had soon\ntaken a large booty, which the Lion requested the Ass to divide\nbetween them. The Ass divided it all into three equal parts, and\nmodestly begged the others to take their choice; at which the Lion,\nbursting with fury, sprang upon the Ass and tore him to pieces.\nThen, glaring at the Fox, he bade him make a fresh division. The Fox\ngathered almost the whole in one great heap for the Lion's share,\nleaving only the smallest possible morsel for himself. \"My dear\nfriend,\" said the Lion, \"how did you get the knack of it so well?\" The\nFox replied, \"Me? Oh, I took a lesson from the Ass.\"\n\n    Happy is he who learns from the misfortunes of others.\n\n\n\n\nTHE FOWLER, THE PARTRIDGE, AND THE COCK\n\n\nOne day, as a Fowler was sitting down to a scanty supper of herbs and\nbread, a friend dropped in unexpectedly. The larder was empty; so he\nwent out and caught a tame Partridge, which he kept as a decoy, and\nwas about to wring her neck when she cried, \"Surely you won't kill me?\nWhy, what will you do without me next time you go fowling? How will\nyou get the birds to come to your nets?\" He let her go at this, and\nwent to his hen-house, where he had a plump young Cock. When the Cock\nsaw what he was after, he too pleaded for his life, and said, \"If you\nkill me, how will you know the time of night? and who will wake you up\nin the morning when it is time to get to work?\" The Fowler, however,\nreplied, \"You are useful for telling the time, I know; but, for all\nthat, I can't send my friend supperless to bed.\" And therewith he\ncaught him and wrung his neck.\n\n\n\n\nTHE GNAT AND THE LION\n\n\nA Gnat once went up to a Lion and said, \"I am not in the least afraid\nof you: I don't even allow that you are a match for me in strength.\nWhat does your strength amount to after all? That you can scratch\nwith your claws and bite with your teeth--just like a woman in a\ntemper--and nothing more. But I'm stronger than you: if you don't\nbelieve it, let us fight and see.\" So saying, the Gnat sounded his\nhorn, and darted in and bit the Lion on the nose. When the Lion felt\nthe sting, in his haste to crush him he scratched his nose badly, and\nmade it bleed, but failed altogether to hurt the Gnat, which buzzed\noff in triumph, elated by its victory. Presently, however, it got\nentangled in a spider's web, and was caught and eaten by the spider,\nthus falling a prey to an insignificant insect after having triumphed\nover the King of the Beasts.\n\n\n\n\nTHE FARMER AND HIS DOGS\n\n\nA Farmer was snowed up in his farmstead by a severe storm, and was\nunable to go out and procure provisions for himself and his family. So\nhe first killed his sheep and used them for food; then, as the storm\nstill continued, he killed his goats; and, last of all, as the weather\nshowed no signs of improving, he was compelled to kill his oxen and\neat them. When his Dogs saw the various animals being killed and eaten\nin turn, they said to one another, \"We had better get out of this or\nwe shall be the next to go!\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE EAGLE AND THE FOX\n\n\nAn Eagle and a Fox became great friends and determined to live near\none another: they thought that the more they saw of each other the\nbetter friends they would be. So the Eagle built a nest at the top of\na high tree, while the Fox settled in a thicket at the foot of it and\nproduced a litter of cubs. One day the Fox went out foraging for food,\nand the Eagle, who also wanted food for her young, flew down into the\nthicket, caught up the Fox's cubs, and carried them up into the tree\nfor a meal for herself and her family. When the Fox came back, and\nfound out what had happened, she was not so much sorry for the loss of\nher cubs as furious because she couldn't get at the Eagle and pay her\nout for her treachery. So she sat down not far off and cursed her. But\nit wasn't long before she had her revenge. Some villagers happened to\nbe sacrificing a goat on a neighbouring altar, and the Eagle flew down\nand carried off a piece of burning flesh to her nest. There was a\nstrong wind blowing, and the nest caught fire, with the result that\nher fledglings fell half-roasted to the ground. Then the Fox ran to\nthe spot and devoured them in full sight of the Eagle.\n\n    False faith may escape human punishment, but cannot escape the\n    divine.\n\n\n\n\nTHE BUTCHER AND HIS CUSTOMERS\n\n\nTwo Men were buying meat at a Butcher's stall in the market-place,\nand, while the Butcher's back was turned for a moment, one of them\nsnatched up a joint and hastily thrust it under the other's cloak,\nwhere it could not be seen. When the Butcher turned round, he missed\nthe meat at once, and charged them with having stolen it: but the one\nwho had taken it said he hadn't got it, and the one who had got it\nsaid he hadn't taken it. The Butcher felt sure they were deceiving\nhim, but he only said, \"You may cheat me with your lying, but you\ncan't cheat the gods, and they won't let you off so lightly.\"\n\n    Prevarication often amounts to perjury.\n\n\n\n\nHERCULES AND MINERVA\n\n\nHercules was once travelling along a narrow road when he saw lying on\nthe ground in front of him what appeared to be an apple, and as he\npassed he stamped upon it with his heel. To his astonishment, instead\nof being crushed it doubled in size; and, on his attacking it again\nand smiting it with his club, it swelled up to an enormous size and\nblocked up the whole road. Upon this he dropped his club, and stood\nlooking at it in amazement. Just then Minerva appeared, and said to\nhim, \"Leave it alone, my friend; that which you see before you is the\napple of discord: if you do not meddle with it, it remains small as it\nwas at first, but if you resort to violence it swells into the thing\nyou see.\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE FOX WHO SERVED A LION\n\n\nA Lion had a Fox to attend on him, and whenever they went hunting the\nFox found the prey and the Lion fell upon it and killed it, and then\nthey divided it between them in certain proportions. But the Lion\nalways got a very large share, and the Fox a very small one, which\ndidn't please the latter at all; so he determined to set up on his own\naccount. He began by trying to steal a lamb from a flock of sheep: but\nthe shepherd saw him and set his dogs on him. The hunter was now the\nhunted, and was very soon caught and despatched by the dogs.\n\n    Better servitude with safety than freedom with danger.\n\n\n\n\nTHE QUACK DOCTOR\n\n\nA certain man fell sick and took to his bed. He consulted a number of\ndoctors from time to time, and they all, with one exception, told him\nthat his life was in no immediate danger, but that his illness would\nprobably last a considerable time. The one who took a different view\nof his case, who was also the last to be consulted, bade him prepare\nfor the worst: \"You have not twenty-four hours to live,\" said he, \"and\nI fear I can do nothing.\" As it turned out, however, he was quite\nwrong; for at the end of a few days the sick man quitted his bed and\ntook a walk abroad, looking, it is true, as pale as a ghost. In the\ncourse of his walk he met the Doctor who had prophesied his death.\n\"Dear me,\" said the latter, \"how do you do? You are fresh from the\nother world, no doubt. Pray, how are our departed friends getting on\nthere?\" \"Most comfortably,\" replied the other, \"for they have drunk\nthe water of oblivion, and have forgotten all the troubles of life. By\nthe way, just before I left, the authorities were making arrangements\nto prosecute all the doctors, because they won't let sick men die in\nthe course of nature, but use their arts to keep them alive. They were\ngoing to charge you along with the rest, till I assured them that you\nwere no doctor, but a mere impostor.\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE LION, THE WOLF, AND THE FOX\n\n\nA Lion, infirm with age, lay sick in his den, and all the beasts of\nthe forest came to inquire after his health with the exception of the\nFox. The Wolf thought this was a good opportunity for paying off old\nscores against the Fox, so he called the attention of the Lion to his\nabsence, and said, \"You see, sire, that we have all come to see how\nyou are except the Fox, who hasn't come near you, and doesn't care\nwhether you are well or ill.\" Just then the Fox came in and heard the\nlast words of the Wolf. The Lion roared at him in deep displeasure,\nbut he begged to be allowed to explain his absence, and said, \"Not one\nof them cares for you so much as I, sire, for all the time I have\nbeen going round to the doctors and trying to find a cure for your\nillness.\" \"And may I ask if you have found one?\" said the Lion. \"I\nhave, sire,\" said the Fox, \"and it is this: you must flay a Wolf\nand wrap yourself in his skin while it is still warm.\" The Lion\naccordingly turned to the Wolf and struck him dead with one blow of\nhis paw, in order to try the Fox's prescription; but the Fox laughed\nand said to himself, \"That's what comes of stirring up ill-will.\"\n\n\n\n\nHERCULES AND PLUTUS\n\n\nWhen Hercules was received among the gods and was entertained at a\nbanquet by Jupiter, he responded courteously to the greetings of\nall with the exception of Plutus, the god of wealth. When Plutus\napproached him, he cast his eyes upon the ground, and turned away and\npretended not to see him. Jupiter was surprised at this conduct on his\npart, and asked why, after having been so cordial with all the other\ngods, he had behaved like that to Plutus. \"Sire,\" said Hercules, \"I\ndo not like Plutus, and I will tell you why. When we were on earth\ntogether I always noticed that he was to be found in the company of\nscoundrels.\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE FOX AND THE LEOPARD\n\n\nA Fox and a Leopard were disputing about their looks, and each claimed\nto be the more handsome of the two. The Leopard said, \"Look at my\nsmart coat; you have nothing to match that.\" But the Fox replied,\n\"Your coat may be smart, but my wits are smarter still.\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE FOX AND THE HEDGEHOG\n\n\nA Fox, in swimming across a rapid river, was swept away by the current\nand carried a long way downstream in spite of his struggles, until at\nlast, bruised and exhausted, he managed to scramble on to dry\nground from a backwater. As he lay there unable to move, a swarm of\nhorseflies settled on him and sucked his blood undisturbed, for he was\ntoo weak even to shake them off. A Hedgehog saw him, and asked if he\nshould brush away the flies that were tormenting him; but the Fox\nreplied, \"Oh, please, no, not on any account, for these flies have\nsucked their fill and are taking very little from me now; but, if you\ndrive them off, another swarm of hungry ones will come and suck all\nthe blood I have left, and leave me without a drop in my veins.\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE CROW AND THE RAVEN\n\n\nA Crow became very jealous of a Raven, because the latter was\nregarded by men as a bird of omen which foretold the future, and was\naccordingly held in great respect by them. She was very anxious to\nget the same sort of reputation herself; and, one day, seeing some\ntravellers approaching, she flew on to a branch of a tree at the\nroadside and cawed as loud as she could. The travellers were in some\ndismay at the sound, for they feared it might be a bad omen; till one\nof them, spying the Crow, said to his companions, \"It's all right,\nmy friends, we can go on without fear, for it's only a crow and that\nmeans nothing.\"\n\n    Those who pretend to be something they are not only make\n    themselves ridiculous.\n\n\n\n\nTHE WITCH\n\n\nA Witch professed to be able to avert the anger of the gods by means\nof charms, of which she alone possessed the secret; and she drove a\nbrisk trade, and made a fat livelihood out of it. But certain persons\naccused her of black magic and carried her before the judges, and\ndemanded that she should be put to death for dealings with the Devil.\nShe was found guilty and condemned to death: and one of the judges\nsaid to her as she was leaving the dock, \"You say you can avert the\nanger of the gods. How comes it, then, that you have failed to disarm\nthe enmity of men?\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE OLD MAN AND DEATH\n\n\nAn Old Man cut himself a bundle of faggots in a wood and started to\ncarry them home. He had a long way to go, and was tired out before he\nhad got much more than half-way. Casting his burden on the ground, he\ncalled upon Death to come and release him from his life of toil. The\nwords were scarcely out of his mouth when, much to his dismay, Death\nstood before him and professed his readiness to serve him. He was\nalmost frightened out of his wits, but he had enough presence of mind\nto stammer out, \"Good sir, if you'd be so kind, pray help me up with\nmy burden again.\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE MISER\n\n\nA Miser sold everything he had, and melted down his hoard of gold into\na single lump, which he buried secretly in a field. Every day he went\nto look at it, and would sometimes spend long hours gloating over his\ntreasure. One of his men noticed his frequent visits to the spot,\nand one day watched him and discovered his secret. Waiting his\nopportunity, he went one night and dug up the gold and stole it. Next\nday the Miser visited the place as usual, and, finding his treasure\ngone, fell to tearing his hair and groaning over his loss. In this\ncondition he was seen by one of his neighbours, who asked him what\nhis trouble was. The Miser told him of his misfortune; but the other\nreplied, \"Don't take it so much to heart, my friend; put a brick into\nthe hole, and take a look at it every day: you won't be any worse off\nthan before, for even when you had your gold it was of no earthly use\nto you.\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE FOXES AND THE RIVER\n\n\nA number of Foxes assembled on the bank of a river and wanted to\ndrink; but the current was so strong and the water looked so deep and\ndangerous that they didn't dare to do so, but stood near the edge\nencouraging one another not to be afraid. At last one of them, to\nshame the rest, and show how brave he was, said, \"I am not a bit\nfrightened! See, I'll step right into the water!\" He had no sooner\ndone so than the current swept him off his feet. When the others saw\nhim being carried down-stream they cried, \"Don't go and leave us! Come\nback and show us where we too can drink with safety.\" But he replied,\n\"I'm afraid I can't yet: I want to go to the seaside, and this current\nwill take me there nicely. When I come back I'll show you with\npleasure.\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE HORSE AND THE STAG\n\n\nThere was once a Horse who used to graze in a meadow which he had all\nto himself. But one day a Stag came into the meadow, and said he had\nas good a right to feed there as the Horse, and moreover chose all the\nbest places for himself. The Horse, wishing to be revenged upon his\nunwelcome visitor, went to a man and asked if he would help him to\nturn out the Stag. \"Yes,\" said the man, \"I will by all means; but I\ncan only do so if you let me put a bridle in your mouth and mount on\nyour back.\" The Horse agreed to this, and the two together very soon\nturned the Stag out of the pasture: but when that was done, the Horse\nfound to his dismay that in the man he had got a master for good.\n\n\n\n\nTHE FOX AND THE BRAMBLE\n\n\nIn making his way through a hedge a Fox missed his footing and caught\nat a Bramble to save himself from falling. Naturally, he got badly\nscratched, and in disgust he cried to the Bramble, \"It was your help\nI wanted, and see how you have treated me! I'd sooner have fallen\noutright.\" The Bramble, interrupting him, replied, \"You must have lost\nyour wits, my friend, to catch at me, who am myself always catching at\nothers.\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE FOX AND THE SNAKE\n\n\nA Snake, in crossing a river, was carried away by the current, but\nmanaged to wriggle on to a bundle of thorns which was floating by, and\nwas thus carried at a great rate down-stream. A Fox caught sight of\nit from the bank as it went whirling along, and called out, \"Gad! the\npassenger fits the ship!\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE LION, THE FOX, AND THE STAG\n\n\nA Lion lay sick in his den, unable to provide himself with food. So\nhe said to his friend the Fox, who came to ask how he did, \"My good\nfriend, I wish you would go to yonder wood and beguile the big Stag,\nwho lives there, to come to my den: I have a fancy to make my dinner\noff a stag's heart and brains.\" The Fox went to the wood and found the\nStag and said to him, \"My dear sir, you're in luck. You know the Lion,\nour King: well, he's at the point of death, and has appointed you his\nsuccessor to rule over the beasts. I hope you won't forget that I was\nthe first to bring you the good news. And now I must be going back to\nhim; and, if you take my advice, you'll come too and be with him at\nthe last.\" The Stag was highly flattered, and followed the Fox to the\nLion's den, suspecting nothing. No sooner had he got inside than the\nLion sprang upon him, but he misjudged his spring, and the Stag got\naway with only his ears torn, and returned as fast as he could to the\nshelter of the wood. The Fox was much mortified, and the Lion, too,\nwas dreadfully disappointed, for he was getting very hungry in spite\nof his illness. So he begged the Fox to have another try at coaxing\nthe Stag to his den. \"It'll be almost impossible this time,\" said the\nFox, \"but I'll try\"; and off he went to the wood a second time, and\nfound the Stag resting and trying to recover from his fright. As soon\nas he saw the Fox he cried, \"You scoundrel, what do you mean by trying\nto lure me to my death like that? Take yourself off, or I'll do you\nto death with my horns.\" But the Fox was entirely shameless. \"What a\ncoward you were,\" said he; \"surely you didn't think the Lion meant any\nharm? Why, he was only going to whisper some royal secrets into your\near when you went off like a scared rabbit. You have rather disgusted\nhim, and I'm not sure he won't make the wolf King instead, unless you\ncome back at once and show you've got some spirit. I promise you he\nwon't hurt you, and I will be your faithful servant.\" The Stag was\nfoolish enough to be persuaded to return, and this time the Lion made\nno mistake, but overpowered him, and feasted right royally upon his\ncarcase. The Fox, meanwhile, watched his chance and, when the Lion\nwasn't looking, filched away the brains to reward him for his trouble.\nPresently the Lion began searching for them, of course without\nsuccess: and the Fox, who was watching him, said, \"I don't think it's\nmuch use your looking for the brains: a creature who twice walked into\na Lion's den can't have got any.\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE MAN WHO LOST HIS SPADE\n\n\nA Man was engaged in digging over his vineyard, and one day on coming\nto work he missed his Spade. Thinking it may have been stolen by one\nof his labourers, he questioned them closely, but they one and all\ndenied any knowledge of it. He was not convinced by their denials, and\ninsisted that they should all go to the town and take oath in a temple\nthat they were not guilty of the theft. This was because he had no\ngreat opinion of the simple country deities, but thought that the\nthief would not pass undetected by the shrewder gods of the town. When\nthey got inside the gates the first thing they heard was the town\ncrier proclaiming a reward for information about a thief who had\nstolen something from the city temple. \"Well,\" said the Man to\nhimself, \"it strikes me I had better go back home again. If these town\ngods can't detect the thieves who steal from their own temples, it's\nscarcely likely they can tell me who stole my Spade.\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE PARTRIDGE AND THE FOWLER\n\n\nA Fowler caught a Partridge in his nets, and was just about to wring\nits neck when it made a piteous appeal to him to spare its life and\nsaid, \"Do not kill me, but let me live and I will repay you for your\nkindness by decoying other partridges into your nets.\" \"No,\" said the\nFowler, \"I will not spare you. I was going to kill you anyhow, and\nafter that treacherous speech you thoroughly deserve your fate.\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE RUNAWAY SLAVE\n\n\nA Slave, being discontented with his lot, ran away from his master. He\nwas soon missed by the latter, who lost no time in mounting his horse\nand setting out in pursuit of the fugitive. He presently came up with\nhim, and the Slave, in the hope of avoiding capture, slipped into a\ntreadmill and hid himself there. \"Aha,\" said his master, \"that's the\nvery place for you, my man!\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE HUNTER AND THE WOODMAN\n\n\nA Hunter was searching in the forest for the tracks of a lion, and,\ncatching sight presently of a Woodman engaged in felling a tree, he\nwent up to him and asked him if he had noticed a lion's footprints\nanywhere about, or if he knew where his den was. The Woodman answered,\n\"If you will come with me, I will show you the lion himself.\" The\nHunter turned pale with fear, and his teeth chattered as he replied,\n\"Oh, I'm not looking for the lion, thanks, but only for his tracks.\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE SERPENT AND THE EAGLE\n\n\nAn Eagle swooped down upon a Serpent and seized it in his talons with\nthe intention of carrying it off and devouring it. But the Serpent was\ntoo quick for him and had its coils round him in a moment; and then\nthere ensued a life-and-death struggle between the two. A countryman,\nwho was a witness of the encounter, came to the assistance of the\nEagle, and succeeded in freeing him from the Serpent and enabling him\nto escape. In revenge the Serpent spat some of his poison into the\nman's drinking-horn. Heated with his exertions, the man was about to\nslake his thirst with a draught from the horn, when the Eagle knocked\nit out of his hand, and spilled its contents upon the ground.\n\n    One good turn deserves another.\n\n\n\n\nTHE ROGUE AND THE ORACLE\n\n\nA Rogue laid a wager that he would prove the Oracle at Delphi to be\nuntrustworthy by procuring from it a false reply to an inquiry by\nhimself. So he went to the temple on the appointed day with a small\nbird in his hand, which he concealed under the folds of his cloak,\nand asked whether what he held in his hand were alive or dead. If the\nOracle said \"dead,\" he meant to produce the bird alive: if the reply\nwas \"alive,\" he intended to wring its neck and show it to be dead. But\nthe Oracle was one too many for him, for the answer he got was this:\n\"Stranger, whether the thing that you hold in your hand be alive\nor dead is a matter that depends entirely on your own will.\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE HORSE AND THE ASS\n\n\nA Horse, proud of his fine harness, met an Ass on the high-road. As\nthe Ass with his heavy burden moved slowly out of the way to let him\npass, the Horse cried out impatiently that he could hardly resist\nkicking him to make him move faster. The Ass held his peace, but did\nnot forget the other's insolence. Not long afterwards the Horse became\nbroken-winded, and was sold by his owner to a farmer. One day, as he\nwas drawing a dung-cart, he met the Ass again, who in turn derided him\nand said, \"Aha! you never thought to come to this, did you, you who\nwere so proud! Where are all your gay trappings now?\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE DOG CHASING A WOLF\n\n\nA Dog was chasing a Wolf, and as he ran he thought what a fine fellow\nhe was, and what strong legs he had, and how quickly they covered the\nground. \"Now, there's this Wolf,\" he said to himself, \"what a poor\ncreature he is: he's no match for me, and he knows it and so he runs\naway.\" But the Wolf looked round just then and said, \"Don't you\nimagine I'm running away from you, my friend: it's your master I'm\nafraid of.\"\n\n\n\n\nGRIEF AND HIS DUE\n\n\nWhen Jupiter was assigning the various gods their privileges, it so\nhappened that Grief was not present with the rest: but when all had\nreceived their share, he too entered and claimed his due. Jupiter was\nat a loss to know what to do, for there was nothing left for him.\nHowever, at last he decided that to him should belong the tears that\nare shed for the dead. Thus it is the same with Grief as it is with\nthe other gods. The more devoutly men render to him his due, the\nmore lavish is he of that which he has to bestow. It is not well,\ntherefore, to mourn long for the departed; else Grief, whose sole\npleasure is in such mourning, will be quick to send fresh cause for\ntears.\n\n\n\n\nTHE HAWK, THE KITE, AND THE PIGEONS\n\n\nThe Pigeons in a certain dovecote were persecuted by a Kite, who every\nnow and then swooped down and carried off one of their number. So they\ninvited a Hawk into the dovecote to defend them against their enemy.\nBut they soon repented of their folly: for the Hawk killed more of\nthem in a day than the Kite had done in a year.\n\n\n\n\nTHE WOMAN AND THE FARMER\n\n\nA Woman, who had lately lost her husband, used to go every day to his\ngrave and lament her loss. A Farmer, who was engaged in ploughing not\nfar from the spot, set eyes upon the Woman and desired to have her\nfor his wife: so he left his plough and came and sat by her side,\nand began to shed tears himself. She asked him why he wept; and he\nreplied, \"I have lately lost my wife, who was very dear to me, and\ntears ease my grief.\" \"And I,\" said she, \"have lost my husband.\" And\nso for a while they mourned in silence. Then he said, \"Since you and I\nare in like case, shall we not do well to marry and live together? I\nshall take the place of your dead husband, and you, that of my dead\nwife.\" The Woman consented to the plan, which indeed seemed reasonable\nenough: and they dried their tears. Meanwhile, a thief had come\nand stolen the oxen which the Farmer had left with his plough. On\ndiscovering the theft, he beat his breast and loudly bewailed his\nloss. When the Woman heard his cries, she came and said, \"Why, are you\nweeping still?\" To which he replied, \"Yes, and I mean it this time.\"\n\n\n\n\nPROMETHEUS AND THE MAKING OF MAN\n\n\nAt the bidding of Jupiter, Prometheus set about the creation of Man\nand the other animals. Jupiter, seeing that Mankind, the only rational\ncreatures, were far outnumbered by the irrational beasts, bade him\nredress the balance by turning some of the latter into men. Prometheus\ndid as he was bidden, and this is the reason why some people have the\nforms of men but the souls of beasts.\n\n\n\n\nTHE SWALLOW AND THE CROW\n\n\nA Swallow was once boasting to a Crow about her birth. \"I was once a\nprincess,\" said she, \"the daughter of a King of Athens, but my husband\nused me cruelly, and cut out my tongue for a slight fault. Then, to\nprotect me from further injury, I was turned by Juno into a bird.\"\n\"You chatter quite enough as it is,\" said the Crow. \"What you would\nhave been like if you hadn't lost your tongue, I can't think.\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE HUNTER AND THE HORSEMAN\n\n\nA Hunter went out after game, and succeeded in catching a hare, which\nhe was carrying home with him when he met a man on horseback, who said\nto him, \"You have had some sport I see, sir,\" and offered to buy it.\nThe Hunter readily agreed; but the Horseman had no sooner got the\nhare in his hands than he set spurs to his horse and went off at full\ngallop. The Hunter ran after him for some little distance; but it soon\ndawned upon him that he had been tricked, and he gave up trying to\novertake the Horseman, and, to save his face, called after him as loud\nas he could, \"All right, sir, all right, take your hare: it was meant\nall along as a present.\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE GOATHERD AND THE WILD GOATS\n\n\nA Goatherd was tending his goats out at pasture when he saw a number\nof Wild Goats approach and mingle with his flock. At the end of the\nday he drove them home and put them all into the pen together. Next\nday the weather was so bad that he could not take them out as usual:\nso he kept them at home in the pen, and fed them there. He only gave\nhis own goats enough food to keep them from starving, but he gave the\nWild Goats as much as they could eat and more; for he was very anxious\nfor them to stay, and he thought that if he fed them well they\nwouldn't want to leave him. When the weather improved, he took them\nall out to pasture again; but no sooner had they got near the hills\nthan the Wild Goats broke away from the flock and scampered off. The\nGoatherd was very much disgusted at this, and roundly abused them for\ntheir ingratitude. \"Rascals!\" he cried, \"to run away like that after\nthe way I've treated you!\" Hearing this, one of them turned round and\nsaid, \"Oh, yes, you treated us all right--too well, in fact; it was\njust that that put us on our guard. If you treat newcomers like\nourselves so much better than your own flock, it's more than likely\nthat, if another lot of strange goats joined yours, _we_ should then\nbe neglected in favour of the last comers.\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE NIGHTINGALE AND THE SWALLOW\n\n\nA Swallow, conversing with a Nightingale, advised her to quit the\nleafy coverts where she made her home, and to come and live with men,\nlike herself, and nest under the shelter of their roofs. But the\nNightingale replied, \"Time was when I too, like yourself, lived among\nmen: but the memory of the cruel wrongs I then suffered makes them\nhateful to me, and never again will I approach their dwellings.\"\n\n    The scene of past sufferings revives painful memories.\n\n\n\n\nTHE TRAVELLER AND FORTUNE\n\n\nA Traveller, exhausted with fatigue after a long journey, sank down at\nthe very brink of a deep well and presently fell asleep. He was within\nan ace of falling in, when Dame Fortune appeared to him and touched\nhim on the shoulder, cautioning him to move further away. \"Wake up,\ngood sir, I pray you,\" she said; \"had you fallen into the well, the\nblame would have been thrown not on your own folly but on me, Fortune.\"\n\n\n\n\nILLUSTRATIONS\n\n\n[Illustration: THE HARE AND THE TORTOISE]\n\n[Illustration: THE MOON AND HER MOTHER]\n\n[Illustration: THE FIR-TREE AND THE BRAMBLE]\n\n[Illustration: THE CRAB AND HIS MOTHER]\n\n[Illustration: THE QUACK FROG]\n\n[Illustration: THE SHIPWRECKED MAN AND THE SEA]\n\n[Illustration: THE BLACKAMOOR]\n\n[Illustration: THE TWO POTS]\n\n[Illustration: VENUS AND THE CAT]\n\n[Illustration: THE TRAVELLERS AND THE PLANE-TREE]\n\n[Illustration: THE TREES AND THE AXE]\n\n[Illustration: THE LION, JUPITER, AND THE ELEPHANT]\n\n[Illustration: THE GNAT AND THE LION]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Aesop's Fables, by Aesop\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK AESOP'S FABLES ***\n\n***** This file should be named 11339-8.txt or 11339-8.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        https://www.gutenberg.org/1/1/3/3/11339/\n\nProduced by Suzanne Shell, Greg Chapman and the Online Distributed\nProofreading Team.\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at https://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttps://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\nbusiness@pglaf.org.  Email contact links and up to date contact\ninformation can be found at the Foundation's web site and official\npage at https://pglaf.org\n\nFor additional contact information:\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit https://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: https://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nEach eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's\neBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,\ncompressed (zipped), HTML and others.\n\nCorrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over\nthe old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.\nVERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving\nnew filenames and etext numbers.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     https://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n\nEBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,\nare filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to\ndownload any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular\nsearch system you may utilize the following addresses and just\ndownload by the etext year.\n\n     https://www.gutenberg.org/etext06\n\n    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,\n     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)\n\nEBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are\nfiled in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part\nof the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is\nidentical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single\ndigits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For\nexample an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:\n\n     https://www.gutenberg.org/1/0/2/3/10234\n\nor filename 24689 would be found at:\n     https://www.gutenberg.org/2/4/6/8/24689\n\nAn alternative method of locating eBooks:\n     https://www.gutenberg.org/GUTINDEX.ALL\n\n"},{"slug":"index.html","itemPath":"uploads/index.html","content":"\u003c!doctype HTML\u003e\n\u003chtml lang=\"en\"\u003e\n  \u003chead\u003e\n    \u003cmeta charset=\"utf-8\"\u003e\n    \u003ctitle\u003eMy JavaScripting Master's Student Project\u003c/title\u003e\n  \u003c/head\u003e\n  \u003cbody\u003e\n    \u003ch1\u003eThis is my project!\u003c/h1\u003e\n    \u003cscript src=\"script.js\"\u003e\u003c/script\u003e\n  \u003c/body\u003e\n\u003c/html\u003e"},{"slug":"mobydick.txt","itemPath":"uploads/mobydick.txt","content":"ipurcbasefc for tbe Sltbrars of \n\nbe TUniverait? of {Toronto \n\nout of tbe proceeds of tbe fun\u0026 \n\nbequeatbefc bp \n\n\n\nStewart, \n\nOB.

He was ever dusting his old lexicons and \ngrammars, with a queer handkerchief, mockingly embellished \nwith all the gay flags of all the known nations of the world. \nHe loved to dust his old grammars ; it somehow mildly \nreminded him of his mortality. \n\n\n\nETYMOLOGY \n\n\n\n' WHILE you take in hand to school others, and to teach \nthem by what name a whale-fish is to be called in our tongue, \nleaving out, through ignorance, the letter H, which almost \nalone maketh up the signification of the word, you deliver \nthat which is not true.' Hakluyt. \n\n1 WHALE. * * * Sw. and Dan. hval. This animal is \nnamed from roundness or rolling ; for in Dan. hvalt is arched \nor vaulted.' Webster's Dictionary. \n\n' WHALE. * * * It is more immediately from the Dut. \nand Ger. W alien ; A.S. Walw-ian y to roll, to wallow.' \n\nRichardson's Dictionary. \n\nHebrew. \n\nGreek. \n\nLatin, \n\nAnglo-Saxon. \n\nDanish. \n\nDutch. \n\nSwedish. \n\nIcelandic. \n\nEnglish. \n\n\n\nin, \n\n\n\nCETUS, \n\nWHCEL, \n\nHVALT, \n\nWAL, \n\nHWAL, \n\nWHALE, \n\nWHALE, \n\nBALEINE, \n\nBALLENA, \n\nPEKEE-NUEE-NUEE, \n\nPEHEE-NUEE-NUEE, \n\n\n\nFrench. \nSpanish. \nFeegee. \nErromangoan. \n\n\n\nEXTRACTS \n(SUPPLIED BY A SUB-SUB-LIBRARIAN) \n\nIT will be seen that this mere painstaking burrower and \ngrub -worm of a poor devil of a Sub -Sub appears to have gone \nthrough the long Vaticans and street-stalls of the earth, pick- \ning up whatever random allusions to whales he could anyways \nfind in any book whatsoever, sacred or profane. Therefore \nyou must not, in every case at least, take the higgledy-piggledy \nwhale statements, however authentic, in these extracts, for \nveritable gospel cetology. Far from it. As touching the \nancient authors generally, as well as the poets here appearing, \nthese extracts are solely valuable or entertaining, as affording \na glancing bird's-eye view of what has been promiscuously \nsaid, thought, fancied, and sung of Leviathan, by many \nnations and generations, including our own. \n\nSo fare thee well, poor devil of a Sub-Sub, whose commen- \ntator I am. Thou belongest to that hopeless, sallow tribe \nwhich no wine of this world will ever warm ; and for whom \neven Pale Sherry would be too rosy-strong ; but with whom \none sometimes loves to sit, and feel poor-devilish, too ; and \ngrow convivial upon tears ; and say to them bluntly with full \neyes and empty glasses, and in not altogether unpleasant \nsadness Give it up, Sub-Subs ! For by how much the more \npains ye take to please the world, by so much the more shall \nye forever go thankless ! Would that I could clear out \nHampton Court and the Tuileries for ye ! But gulp down \nyour tears and hie aloft to the royal-mast with your hearts ; \nfor your friends who have gone before are clearing out the \nseven-storied heavens, and making refugees of long-pampered \nGabriel, Michael, and Raphael, against your coming. Here \nye strike but splintered hearts together there, ye shall \nstrike unsplinterable glasses! \n\n\n\nxii \n\n\n\nEXTRACTS \n\n' And God created great whales.' \n\n\n\nGenesis. \n\n\n\n* Leviathan maketh a path to shine after him ; \nOne would think the deep to be hoary.' \n\nJob. \n\n' Now the Lord had prepared a great fish to swallow up \nJonah.' Jonah. \n\n' There go the ships ; there is that Leviathan whom thou \nhast made to play therein.' Psalms. \n\n' In that day, the Lord with his sore, and great, and strong \nsword, shall punish Leviathan the piercing serpent, even \nLeviathan that crooked serpent ; and he shall slay the dragon \nthat is in the sea.' Isaiah. \n\n* And what thing soever besides cometh within the chaos \nof this monster's mouth, be it beast, boat, or stone, down it \ngoes all incontinently that foul great swallow of his, and \nperisheth in the bottomless gulf of his paunch.' \n\nHollancFs Plutarch's Morals. \n\n' The Indian Sea breedeth the most and the biggest fishes \nthat are : among which the Whales and Whirlpooles called \nBalaene, take up as much in length as four acres or arpens of \nland.' Holland's Pliny. \n\n' Scarcely had we proceeded two days on the sea, when \nabout sunrise a great many Whales and other monsters of \nthe sea, appeared. Among the former, one was of a most \nmonstrous size. * * * This came towards us, open- \nmouthed, raising the waves on all sides, and beating the sea \nbefore him into a foam.' \n\nTooke's Lucian. The True History. \n\nxiii \n\n\n\nxiv MOBY-DICK \n\n' He visited this country also with a view of catching horse - \nwhales, which had bones of very great value for their teeth, \nof which he brought some to the king. * * * The best \nwhales were catched in his own country, of which some were \nforty-eight, some fifty yards long. He said that he was one \nof six who had killed sixty in two days.' \n\nOther or Octher's verbal narrative taken down \nfrom his mouth by King Alfred, A.D. 890. \n\n1 And whereas all the other things, whether beast or vessel, \nthat enter into the dreadful gulf of this monster's (whale's) \nmouth, are immediately lost and swallowed up, the sea- \ngudgeon retires into it in great security, and there sleeps.' \nMontaigne 1 s Apology for Eaimond Sebond. \n\n' Let us fly, let us fly ! Old Nick take me if it is not \nLeviathan described by the noble prophet Moses in the life \nof patient Job.' Rabelais. \n\n' This whale's liver was two cart-loads.' \n\nStowe's Annals. \n\n1 The great Leviathan that maketh the seas to seethe like \nboiling pan.' Lord Bacon's Version of the Psalms. \n\n' Touching that monstrous bulk of the whale or ork we \nhave received nothing certain. They grow exceeding fat, \ninsomuch that an incredible quantity of oil will be extracted \nout of one whale.' Ibid. History of Life and Death. \n\n1 The sovereignest thing on earth is parmacetti for an in- \nward bruise.' King Henry. \n\n' Very like a whale.' Hamlet. \n\n' Which to secure, no skill of leach's art \nMote him availle, but to returne againe \nTo his wound's worker, that with lowly dart, \nDinting his breast, had bred his restless paine, \nLike as the wounded whale to shore flies thro' the maine.' \n\nThe Fairie Queen. \n\n' Immense as whales, the motion of whose vast bodies can \nin a peaceful calm trouble the ocean till it boil.' \n\nSir William Davenant's Preface to Gondibert. \n\n\n\nEXTRACTS xv \n\n' What spermaceti! is, men might justly doubt, since the \nlearned Hosmannus in his work of thirty years, saith plainly, \nNescio quid sit.' \n\nSir T. Browne's Of Sperma Ceti and the \nSperma Ceti Whale. Vide his V.E. \n\n' Like Spencer's Talus with his modern flail \n\nHe threatens ruin with his ponderous tail. \n****** \n\nTheir fixed jav'lins in his side he wears, \nAnd on his back a grove of pikes appears.' \n\nWaller's Battle of the Summer Islands. \n\n' By art is created that great Leviathan, called a Common- \nwealth or State (in Latin, Civitas) which is but an artificial \nman.' Opening sentence of Hobbes's Leviathan. \n\n'Silly Mansoul swallowed it without chewing, as if it had \nbeen a sprat in the mouth of a whale.' \n\nPilgrim's Progress. \n* That sea beast \n\nLeviathan, which God of all his works \nCreated hugest that swim the ocean stream.' \n\nParadise Lost. \n4 There Leviathan, \n\nHugest of living creatures, in the deep \nStretched like a promontory sleeps or swims, \nAnd seems a moving land ; and at his gills \nDraws in, and at his breath spouts out a sea.' \n\nIbid. \n\n' The mighty whales which swim in a sea of water, and \nhave a sea of oil swimming in them.' \n\nFuller's Profane and Holy State. \n' So close behind some promontory lie \n\nThe huge Leviathans to attend their prey, \nAnd give no chace, but swallow in the fry, \n\nWhich through their gaping jaws mistake the way.' \nDry den's Annus Mirabilis. \n\n' While the whale is floating at the stern of the ship, they \ncut off his head, and tow it with a boat as near the shore as it \nwill come ; but it will be aground in twelve or thirteen feet \nwater.' \n\nThomas Edge's Ten Voyages to Spitzbergen, in Purchas. \n\n\n\nxvi MOBY-DICK \n\n* In their way they saw many whales sporting in the ocean, \nand in wantonness fuzzing up the water through their pipes \nand vents, which nature has placed on their shoulders.' \n\nSir T. Herberts Voyages into Asia and Africa. Harris Coll. \n\n4 Here they saw such huge troops of whales, that they were \nforced to proceed with a great deal of caution for fear they \nshould run their ship upon them.' \n\nSchouten's Sixth Circumnavigation. \n\n* We set sail from the Elbe, wind N.E. in the ship called \nThe Jonas-in-the-Whale. * * * \n\nSome say the whale can't open his mouth, but that is a \nfable. * * * \n\nThey frequently climb up the masts to see whether they \ncan see a whale, for the first discoverer has a ducat for his \npains. * * * \n\nI was told of a whale taken near Shetland, that had above \na barrel of herrings in his belly. * * * \n\nOne of our harpooneers told me that he caught once a \nwhale in Spitzbergen that was white all over.' \n\nA Voyage to Greenland, A.D. 1671. Harris Coll. \n\n' Several whales have come in upon this coast (Fife). Anno \n1652, one eighty feet in length of the whale -bone kind came \nin, which, (as I was informed) besides a vast quantity of oil, \ndid afford 500 weight of baleen.

Some years ago never mind how \nlong precisely having little or no money in my purse, \nand nothing particular to interest me on shore, I thought \nI would sail about a little and see the watery part of the \nworld. It is a way I have of driving off the spleen, and \nregulating the circulation. Whenever I find myself \ngrowing grim about the mouth ; whenever it is a damp, \ndrizzly November in my soul ; whenever I find myself \ninvoluntarily pausing before coffin warehouses, and bring- \ning up the rear of every funeral I meet ; and especially \nwhenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that \nit requires a strong moral principle to prevent me from \ndeliberately stepping into the street, and methodically \nknocking people's hats off then, I account it high time \nto get to sea as soon as I can. This is my substitute for \npistol and ball. With a philosophical flourish Cato throws \nhimself upon his sword ; I quietly take to the ship. \nThere is nothing surprising in this. If they but knew \nit, almost all men in their degree, some time or other, \ncherish very nearly the same feelings toward the ocean \nwith me. \n\nThere now is your insular city of the Manhattoes, \nbelted round by wharves as Indian isles by coral reefs \ncommerce surrounds it with her surf. Right and left, the \nstreets take you waterward. Its extreme down -town is the \nbattery, where that noble mole is washed by waves, and \n\nVOL. I. A \n\n\n\n2 MOBY-DICK \n\ncooled by breezes, which a few hours previous were out of \nsight of land. Look at the crowds of water -gazers there. \n\nCircumambulate the city of a dreamy Sabbath after- \nnoon. Go from Corlears Hook to Coenties Slip, and \nfrom thence, by Whitehall, northward. What do you \nsee ? Posted like silent sentinels all around the town, \nstand thousands upon thousands of mortal men fixed \nin ocean reveries. Some leaning against the spiles ; \nsome seated upon the pier-heads ; some looking over \nVhe bulwarks of ships from China ; some high aloft in \nthe rigging, as if striving to get a still better seaward \npeep. But these are all landsmen ; of week days pent \nup in lath and plaster tied to counters, nailed to benches, \nclinched to desks. How then is this ? Are the green \nfields gone ? What do they here ? \n\nBut look ! here come more crowds, pacing straight for \nthe water, and seemingly bound for a dive. Strange ! \nNothing will content them but the extremest limit of the \nland ; loitering under the shady lee of yonder warehouses \nwill not suffice. No. They must get just as nigh the \nwater as they possibly can without falling in. And there \nthey stand miles of them leagues. Inlanders all, they \ncome from lanes and alleys, streets and avenues north, \neast, south, and west. Yet here they all unite. Tell me, \ndoes the magnetic virtue of the needles of the compasses \nof all those ships attract them thither ? \n\nOnce more. Say, you are in the country ; in some \nhigh land of lakes. Take almost any path you please, \nand ten to one it carries you down in a dale, and leaves \nyou there by a pool in the stream. There is magic in it. \nLet the most absent-minded of men be plunged in his \ndeepest reveries stand that man on his legs, set his feet \na-going, and he will infallibly lead you to water, if water \nthere be in all that region. Should you ever be athirst \nin the great American desert, try this experiment, if your \n\n\n\nLOOMINGS 3 \n\ncaravan happen to be supplied with a metaphysical \nprofessor. Yes, as everyone knows, meditation andli \nwater are wedded forever. \n\nBut here is an artist. He desires to paint you the \ndreamiest, shadiest, quietest, most enchanting bit of \nromantic landscape in all the valley of the Saco. What \nis the chief element he employs ? There stand his trees, \neach with a hollow trunk, as if a hermit and a crucifix \nwere within ; and here sleeps his meadow, and there sleep \nhis cattle ; and up from yonder cottage goes a sleepy \nsmoke. Deep into distant woodlands winds a mazy way, \nreaching to overlapping spurs of mountains bathed in \ntheir hillside blue. But though the picture lies thus \ntranced, and though this pine-tree shakes down its sighs \nlike leaves upon this shepherd's head, yet all were \nvain, unless the shepherd's eye were fixed upon the \nmagic stream before him. Go visit the Prairies in June, \nwhen for scores on scores of miles you wade knee -deep \namong tiger-lilies what is the one charm wanting ?- \nWater there is not a drop of water there ! Were Niagara \nbut a cataract of sand, would you travel your thousand \nmiles to see it ? Why did the poor poet of Tennessee, \nupon suddenly receiving two handfuls of silver, deliberate \nwhether to buy him a coat, which he sadly needed, or \ninvest his money in a pedestrian trip to Rockaway Beach ? \nWhy is almost every robust healthy boy with a robust \nhealthy soul in him, at some time or other crazy to go to \nsea ? Why upon your first voyage as a passenger, did \nyou yourself feel such a mystical vibration, when first ; \ntold that you and your ship were now out of sight of ' \nland ? Why did the old Persians hold the sea holy ? \nWhy did the Greeks give it a separate deity, and own \nbrother of Jove ? Surely all this is not without meaning. \nAnd still deeper the meaning of that story of Narcissus, \nwho because he could not grasp the tormenting, mild \n\n\n\n4 MOBY-DICK \n\nimage he saw in the fountain, plunged into it and was \ndrowned. But that same image, we ourselves see in all \nrivers and oceans. It is the image of the ungraspable \nphantom of life ; and this is the key to it all. \n\nNow, when I say that I am in the habit of going to sea \nwhenever I begin to grow hazy about the eyes, and begin \nto be over conscious of my lungs, I do not mean to have \nit inferred that I ever go to sea as a passenger. For to \ngo as a passenger you must needs have a purse, and a \npurse is but a rag unless you have something in it. Be- \nsides, passengers get sea-sick grow quarrelsome don't \nsleep of nights do not enjoy themselves much, as a \ngeneral thing ; no, I never go as a passenger ; nor, \nthough I am something of a salt, do I ever go to sea as a \nCommodore, or a Captain, or a Cook. I abandon the \nglory and distinction of such offices to those who like \nthem. For my part, I abominate all honourable respect- \nable toils, trials, and tribulations of every kind what- \nsoever. It is quite as much as I can do to take care \nof myself, without taking care of ships, barques, brigs, \nschooners, and what not. And as for going as cook, \nthough I confess there is considerable glory in that, a \ncook being a sort of officer on shipboard yet, somehow, \nI never fancied broiling fowls ; though once broiled, \njudiciously buttered, and judgmatically salted and \npeppered, there is no one who will speak more respect- \nfully, not to say reverentially, of a broiled fowl than I \nwill. It is out of the idolatrous do tings of the old \nEgyptians upon broiled ibis and roasted river horse, that \nyou see the mummies of those creatures in their huge \nbake-houses the pyramids. \n\nNo, when I go to sea, I go as a simple sailor, right \nbefore the mast, plumb down into the forecastle, aloft \nthere to the royal mast-head. True, they rather order \nme about some, and make me jump from spar to spar, \n\n\n\nLOOMINGS 5 \n\nlike a grasshopper in a May meadow. And at first, this \nsort of thing is unpleasant enough. It touches one's \nsense of honour, particularly if you come of an old estab- \nlished family in the land, the Van Rensselaers, or Ran- \ndolphs, or Hardicanutes. And more than all, if just \nprevious to putting your hand into the tar-pot, you have \nbeen lording it as a country schoolmaster, making the \ntallest boys stand in awe of you. The transition is a \nkeen one, I assure you, from a schoolmaster to a sailor, \nand requires a strong decoction of Seneca and the Stoics \nto enable you to grin and bear it. But even this wears \noff hi time. \n\nWhat of it, if some old hunks of a sea-captain orders \nme to get a broom and sweep down the decks ? What \ndoes that indignity amount to, weighed, I mean, in the \nscales of the New Testament ? Do you think the arch- \nangel Gabriel thinks anything the less of me, because I \npromptly and respectfully obey that old hunks in that \nparticular instance ? Who ain/t a slave ? Tell me that. \nWell, then, however the~old^sea -captains may order me \nabout however they may thump and punch me about, \nI have the satisfaction of knowing that it is all right ; \nthat everybody else is one way or other served in much the \nsame way either in a physical or metaphysical point of \nview, that is ; and so the universal thump is passed \nround, and all hands should rub each other's shoulder- \nblades, and be content. \n\nAgain, I always go to sea as a sailor, because they make \na point of paying me for my trouble, whereas they never \npay passengers a single penny that I ever heard of. On \nthe contrary, passengers themselves must pay. And \nthere is all the difference in the world between paying \nand being paid. The act of paying is perhaps the most \nuncomfortable infliction that the two orchard thieves \nentailed upon us. But being paid, what will compare \n\n\n\n6 MOBY-DICK \n\nwith it ? The urbane activity with which a man receives \nmoney is really marvellous, considering that we so \nearnestly believe money to be the root of all earthly ills, \nand that on no account can a monied man enter heaven. \nAh ! how cheerfully we consign ourselves to perdition ! \n\nFinally, I always go to sea as a sailor, because of the \nwholesome exercise and pure air of the forecastle deck. \nFor as in this world, head-winds are far more prevalent \nthan winds from astern (that is, if you never violate \nthe Pythagorean maxim), so for the most part the com- \nmodore on the quarter-deck gets his atmosphere at \nsecond hand from the sailors on the forecastle. He thinks \nhe breathes it first ; but not so. In much the same \nway do the commonalty lead their leaders in many other \nthings, at the same time that the leaders little suspect it. \nBut wherefore it was that after having repeatedly smelt \nthe sea as a merchant sailor, I should now take it into \nmy head to go on a whaling voyage ; this the invisible \npolice-officer of the Fates, who has the constant surveil- \nlance of me, and secretly dogs me, and influences me in \nsome unaccountable way he can better answer than any \none else. And, doubtless, my going on this whaling \nvoyage formed part of the grand programme of Provi- \ndence that was drawn up a long time ago. It came in \nas a sort of brief interlude and solo between more exten- \nsive performances. I take it that this part of the bill \nmust have run something like this : \n\n' Grand Contested Election for the Presidency of the \nUnited States. \n\n' WHALING VOYAGE BY ONE ISHMAEL. \n\n1 BLOODY BATTLE IN AFGHANISTAN.' \n\nThough I cannot tell why it was exactly that those \nstage managers, the Fates, put me down for this shabby \n\n\n\nLOOMINGS 7 \n\npart of a whaling voyage, when others were set down \nfor magnificent parts in high tragedies, and short and easy \nparts in genteel comedies, and jolly parts in farces \nthough I cannot tell why this was exactly ; yet, now that \nI recall all the circumstances, I think I can see a little \ninto the springs and motives which, being cunningly \npresented to me under various disguises, induced me to \nset about performing the part I did, besides cajoling me \ninto the delusion that it was a choice resulting from my \nown unbiased freewill and discriminating judgment. \n\nChief among these motives was the overwhelming idea \nof the great whale himself. Such a gortentous and \nmysterious monster roused all my curiosity. Then the \nwild and distant seas where he rolled his island bulk ; \nthe undeliverable, nameless perils of the whale ; these, \nwith all the attending marvels of a thousand Patagonian \nsights and sounds, helped to sway me to my wish. With \nother men, perhaps, such things would not have been \ninducements ; but as for me, I am tormented with an \neverlasting itch for things remote. I love to sail for- \nbidden seas, and land on barbarous coasts. Not ignoring \nwhat is good, I am quick to perceive a horror, and could \nstill be social with it would they let me since it is \nbut well to be on friendly terms with all the inmates of \nthe place one lodges in. \n\nBy reason of these things, then, the whaling voyage \nwas welcome ; the great flood-gates of the wonder-world \nswung open, and in the wild conceits that swayed me to \nmy purpose, two and two there floated into my inmost \nsoul, endless processions of the whale, and, midmost of \nthem all, one grand hooded phantom, like a snow hill in \nthe air. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER II \n\nTHE CARPET-BAG \n\nI stuffed a shirt or two into my old carpet-bag, tucked \nit under my arm, and started for Cape Horn and the \nPacific. Quitting the good city of old Manhatto, I duly \narrived in New Bedford. It was on a Saturday night in \nDecember. Much was I disappointed upon learning \nthat the little packet for Nantucket had already sailed, \nand that no way of reaching that place would offer, till \nthe following Monday. \n\nAs most young candidates for the pains and penalties \nof whaling stop at this same New Bedford, thence to \nembark on their voyage, it may as well be related that I 5 \nfor one, had no idea of so doing. For my mind was made \nup to sail in no other than a Nantucket craft, because \nthere was a fine, boisterous something about everything \nconnected with that famous old island, which amazingly \npleased me. Besides, though New Bedford has of late \nbeen gradually monopolising the business of whaling, and \nthough in this matter poor old Nantucket is now much \nbehind her, yet Nantucket was her great original the \nTyre of this Carthage ; the place where the first dead \nAmerican whale was stranded. Where else but from \nNantucket did those aboriginal whalemen, the Red Men, \nfirst sally out in canoes to give chase to the leviathan ? \nAnd where but from Nantucket, too, did that first adven- \nturous little sloop put forth, partly laden with imported \ncobble-stones so goes the story to throw at the whales, \n\n\n\nTHE CARPET-BAG 9 \n\nin order to discover when they were nigh enough to risk \na harpoon from the bowsprit ? \n\nNow having a night, a day, and still another night \nfollowing before me in New Bedford, ere I could embark \nfor my destined port, it became a matter of concernment \nwhere I was to eat and sleep meanwhile. It was a very \ndubious-looking, nay, a very dark and dismal night, \nbitingly cold and cheerless. I knew no one in the place. \nWith anxious grapnelsJE had sounded my pocket, and only \nbrought up a few pieces of silver. So, wherever you go, \nIshmael, said I to myself, as I stood in the middle of a \ndreary street shouldering my bag, and comparing the \ngloom toward the north with the darkness toward the \nsouth wherever in your wisdom you may conclude to \nlodge for the night, my dear Ishmael, be sure to inquire \nthe price, and don't be too particular. \n\nWith halting steps I paced the streets, and passed the \nsign of 'The Crossed Harpoons ' but it looked too expen- \nsive and jolly there. Further on, from the bright red \nwindows of the ' Sword-Fish Inn,' there came such fer- \nvent rays, that it seemed to have melted the packed snow \nand ice from before the house, for everywhere else the \ncongealed frost lay ten inches thick in a hard, asphaltic \npavement, rather weary for me, when I struck my foot \nagainst the flinty projections, because from hard, remorse- \nless service the soles of mv boots were in a most miserable \n\nV \n\nplight. Too expensive and jolly, again thought I, pausing \none moment to watch the broad glare in the street, and \nhear the sounds of the tinkling glasses within. But go i \non, Ishmael, said I at last ; don't you hear ? get away l \nfrom before the door ; your patched boots are stopping \nthe way. So on I went. I now by instinct followed the \nstreets that took me waterward, for there, doubtless, \nwere the cheapest, if not the cheeriest inns. \n\nSuch dreary streets ! blocks of blackness, not houses, \n\n\n\n10 MOBY-DICK \n\non either hand, and here and there a candle, like a candle \nmoving about in a tomb. At this hour of the night, of \nthe last day of the week, that quarter of the town proved \nall but deserted. But presently I carne to a smoky \nlight proceeding from a low, wide building, the door of \nwhich stood invitingly open. It had a careless look, as \nif it were meant for the uses of the public ; so, entering, \nthe first thing I did was to stumble over an ash-box in \nthe porch. Ha ! thought I, ha, as the flying particles \nalmost choked me, are these ashes from that destroyed \ncity, Gomorrah ? But ' The Cfossed Harpoons ' and \n4 The Sword-Fish ' ? this, then, must needs be the sign \nof ' The Trap. ' However, I picked myself up , and hearing \na loud voice within, pushed on and opened a second, \ninterior door. \n\nIt seemed the great Black Parliament sitting in Tophet. \nA hundred black faces turned round in their rows to peer ; \nand beyond, a black Angel of Doom was beating a book \nin a pulpit. It was a negro church ; and the preacher's \ntext was about the blackness of darkness, and the weep- \ning and wailing and teeth -gnashing there. Ha, Ishmael, \nmuttered I, backing out, Wretched entertainment at the \nsign of ' The Trap ' ! \n\nMoving on, I at last came to a dim sort of light not far \nfrom the docks, and heard a forlorn creaking in the air ; \nand looking up, saw a swinging sign over the door with \na white painting upon it, faintly representing a tall straight \njet of misty spray, and these words underneath ' The \nSpouter-Inn : Peter Coffin.' \n\nCoffin ? Spouter ? Rather ominous in that particu- \nlar connection, thought I. But it is a common name in \nNantucket, they say, and I suppose this Peter here is an \nemigrant from there. As the light looked so dim, and \nthe place, for the time, looked quiet enough, and the \ndilapidated little wooden house itself looked as if it might \n\n\n\nTHE CARPET-BAG 11 \n\nhave been carted here from the ruins of some burnt dis- \ntrict, and as the swinging sign had a poverty-stricken sort \nof creak to it, I thought that here was the very spot for \ncheap lodgings, and the best of pea-coffee. \n\nIt was a queer sort of place a gable-ended old house, \none side palsied as it were, and leaning over sadly. It \nstood on a sharp bleak corner, where that tempestuous \nwind Euroclydon kept up a worse howling than ever it \ndid about poor Paul's tossed craft. Euroclydon, never- \ntheless, is a mighty pleasant zephyr to anyone indoors, \nwith his feet on the hob quietly toasting for bed. 4 In \njudging of that tempestuous wind called Euroclydon,' \nsays an old writer of whose works I possess the only \ncopy extant ' it maketh a marvellous difference, \nwhether thou lookest out at it from a glass window where \nthe frost is all on the outside, or whether thou observest \nit from that Cashless window, where the frost is on both \nsides, and of which the wight Death is the only glazier.' \nTrue enough, thought I, as this passage occurred to my \nmind old black-letter, thou reasonest well. Yes, these \neyes are windows, and this body of mine is the house. \nWhat a pity they didn't stop up the chinks and the \ncrannies though, and thrust in a little lint here and there. \nBut it 's too late to make any improvements now. The \nuniverse is finished ; the cope-stone is on, and the chips \nwere carted off a million years ago. Poor Lazarus there, \nchattering his teeth against the curbstone for his pillow, \nand shaking off his tatters with his shiverings, he might \nplug up both ears with rags, and put a corn-cob into his \nmouth, and yet that would not keep out the tempestuous \nEuroclydon. Euroclydon ! says old Dives, in his red \nsilken wrapper (he had a redder one afterward) pooh, \npooh ! What a fine frosty night ; how Orion glitters ; \nwhat northern lights ! Let them talk of their oriental \nsummer climes of everlasting conservatories ; give me \n\n\n\n12 MOBY-DICK \n\nthe privilege of making my own summer with my own \ncoals. \n\nBut what thinks Lazarus ? Can he warm his blue \nhands by holding them up to the grand northern lights ? \nWould not Lazarus rather be in Sumatra than here ? \nWould he not far rather lay him down lengthwise along \nthe line of the equator ; yea, ye gods ! go down to the \nfiery pit itself, in order to keep out this frost ? \n\nNow, that Lazarus should lie stranded there on the \ncurbstone before the door of Dives, this is more wonderful \nthan that an iceberg should be moored to one of the \nMoluccas. Yet Dives himself, he too lives like a Czar \nin an ice-palace made of frozen sighs, and being a president \nof a temperance society, he only drinks the tepid tears of \norphans. \n\nBut no more of this blubbering now, we are going a- \nwhaling, and there is plenty of that yet to come. Let \nus scrape the ice from our frosted feet, and see what sort \nof a place this ' Spouter ' may be. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER III \n\nTHE SPOTTTER-INN \n\nENTERING that gable -ended Spouter-Inn, you found \nyourself in a wide, low, straggling entry with old-fashioned \nwainscots, reminding one of the bulwarks of some con- \ndemned old craft. On one side hung a very large oil- \npainting so thoroughly besmoked, and every way defaced, \nthat in the unequal cross-lights by which you viewed it, \nit was only by diligent study and a series of systematic \nvisits to it, and careful inquiry of the neighbours, that \nyou could any way arrive at an understanding of its \npurpose. Such unaccountable masses of shades and \nshadows, that at first you almost thought some ambitious \nyoung artist, in the time of the New England hags, had \nendeavoured to delineate chaos bewitched. But by dint \nof much and earnest contemplation, and oft-repeated \nponderings, and especially by throwing open the little \nwindow toward the back of the entry, you at last come \nto the conclusion that such an idea, however wild, might \nnot be altogether unwarranted. \n\nBut what most puzzled and confounded you was a \nlong, limber, portentous, black mass of something hover- \ning in the centre of the picture over three blue, dim, \nperpendicular lines floating in a nameless yeast. A boggy, \nsoggy, squitchy picture truly, enough to drive a nervous \nman distracted. Yet there was a sort of indefinite, half- \nattained, unimaginable sublimity about it that fairly \nfroze you to it, till you in voluntarily, took an oath with \nyourself to find out what that marvellous painting meant. \n\nis \n\n\n\n14 MOBY-DICK \n\nEver and anon a bright, but, alas, deceptive idea would \ndart you through. It 's the Black Sea in a midnight gale. \nIt 's the unnatural combat of the four primal elements. \nIt 's a blasted heath. It 's a Hyperborean winter scene. \nIt 's the breaking-up of the ice-bound stream of Time. \nBut at last all these fancies yielded to that one portentous \nsomething in the picture's midst. That once found out, \nand all the rest were plain. But stop ; does it not bear \na faint resemblance to a gigantic fish ? even the great \nleviathan himself ? \n\nIn fact, the artist's design seemed this : a final theory \nof my own, partly based upon the aggregated opinions \nof many aged persons with whom I conversed upon the \nsubject. The picture represents a Cape-Horner in a great \nhurricane ; the half-foundered ship weltering there with \nits three dismantled masts alone visible ; and an exasper- \nated whale, purposing to spring clean over the craft, is \nin the enormous act of impaling himself upon the three \nmast-heads. \n\nThe opposite wall of this entry was hung all over with \na heathenish array of monstrous clubs and spears. Some \nwere thickly set with glittering teeth resembling ivory \nsaws ; others were tufted with knots of human hair ; and \none was sickle-shaped, with a vast handle sweeping round \nlike the segment made in the new-mown grass by a long- \narmed mower. You shuddered as you gazed, and \nwondered what monstrous cannibal and savage could \never have gone a death-harvesting with such a hacking, \nhorrifying implement. Mixed with these were rusty \nold whaling-lances and harpoons all broken and deformed. \nSome were storied weapons. With this once long lance, \nnow wildly elbowed, fifty years ago did Nathan Swain \nkill fifteen whales between a sunrise and a sunset. And \nthat harpoon so like a corkscrew now was flung in \nJavan seas, and run away with by a whale, years after- \n\n\n\nTHE SPOUTER-INN 15 \n\nward slain off the Cape of Blanco. The original iron \nentered nigh the tail, and, like a restless needle sojourning \nin the body of a man, travelled full forty feet, and at last \nwas found imbedded in the hump. \n\nCrossing this dusky entry, and on through yon low- \narched way cut through what in old times must have \nbeen a great central chimney with fire-places all round \nyou enter the public room. A still duskier place is this, \nwith such low ponderous beams above, and such old \nwrinkled planks beneath, that you would almost fancy \nyou trod some old craft's cockpits, especially of such a \nhowling night, when this corner-anchored old ark rocked \nso furiously. On one side stood a long, low, shelf-like \ntable covered with cracked glass cases, filled with dusty \nrarities gathered from this wide world's remotest nooks. \nProjecting from the further angle of the room stands a \ndark-looking den the bar a rude attempt at a right \nwhale's head. Be that how it may, there stands the vast \narched bone of the whale's jaw, so wide, a coach might \nalmost drive beneath it. Within are shabby shelves, \nranged round with old decanters, bottles, flasks ; and in \nthose jaws of swift destruction, like another cursed Jonah \n(by which name indeed they called him), bustles a little \nwithered old man, who, for their money, dearly sells the \nsailors deliriums and death. \n\nAbominable are the tumblers into which he pours his \npoison. Though true cylinders without within, the \nvillainous green goggling glasses deceitfully tapered down- \nward to a cheating bottom. Parallel meridians rudely \npecked into the glass, surround these footpads' goblets. \nFill to this mark, and your charge is but a penny ; to this \na penny more ; and so on to the full glass the Cape \nHorn measure, which you may gulp down for a shilling. \nUpon entering the place I found a number of young \nseamen gathered about a table, examining by a dim light \n\n\n\n16 MOBY-DICK \n\ndivers speiimens of skrimshander. I sought the land- \nlord, and telling him I desired to be accommodated with \na room, received for answer that his house was full not \na bed unoccupied. ' But avast, 5 he added, tapping his \nforehead, ' you hain't no objections to sharin* a har- \npooneer 's blanket, have ye ? I s'pose you are goin' a- \nwhalin 5 , so you 'd better get used to that sort of thing. 5 \n\nI told him that I never liked to sleep two in a bed ; that \nif I should ever do so, it would depend upon who the \nharpooneer might be, and that if he (the landlord) really \nhad no other place for me, and the harpooneer was not \ndecidedly objectionable, why, rather than wander further \nabout a strange town on so bitter a night, I would put \nup with the half of any decent man 5 s blanket. \n\n' I thought so. All right ; take a seat. Supper ? \nyou want supper ? Supper 5 11 be ready directly. 5 \n\nI sat down on an old wooden settle, carved all over like \na bench on the Battery. At one end a ruminating tar \nwas still further adorning it with his jack-knife, stooping \nover and diligently working away at the space between \nhis legs. He was trying his hand at a ship under full sail, \nbut he didn't make much headway, I thought. \n\nAt last some four or five of us were summoned to our \nmeal in an adjoining room. It was cold as Iceland \nno fire at all the landlord said he couldn't afford it. \nNothing but two dismal tallow candles, each in a winding \nsheet. We were fain to button up our monkey-jackets, \nand hold to our lips cups of scalding tea with our half- \nfrozen fingers. But the fare was of the most substantial \nkind not only meat and potatoes, but dumplings ; good \nheavens ! dumplings for supper ! One young fellow in \na green box-coat addressed himself to these dumplings \nhi a most direful manner. \n\n' My boy,' said the landlord, ' you '11 have the night- \nmare to a dead sartainty.' \n\n\n\nTHE SPOUTER-INN 17 \n\n'Landlord,' I whispered, w that ain't the harpooneer, \nis it ? ' \n\n1 Oh, no/ said he, looking a sort of diabolically funny, \n4 the harpooneer is a dark - complexioned chap. He \nnever eats dumplings, he don't he eats nothing but \nsteaks, and likes 'em rare.' \n\n' The devil he does, ' says I. ' Where is that harpooneer ? \nIs he here ? ' \n\n' He '11 be here afore long,' was the answer. \n\nI could not help it, but I began to feel suspicious of \nthis ' dark-complexioned ' harpooneer. At any rate, I \nmade up my mind that if it so turned out that we should \nsleep together, he must undress and get into bed before \nI did. \n\nSupper over, the company went back to the bar-room, \nwhen, knowing not what else to do with myself, I resolved \nto spend the rest of the evening as a looker-on. \n\nPresently a rioting noise was heard without. Starting \nup, the landlord cried, ' That 's the Grampus's crew. I \nseed her reported in the offing this morning ; a three \nyears' voyage, and a full ship. Hurrah, boys ; now we '11 \nhave the latest news from the Feegees.' \n\nA tramping of sea-boots was heard in the entry ; the \ndoor was flung open, and in rolled a wild set of mariners \nenough. Enveloped in their shaggy watch-coats, and \nwith their heads muffled in woollen comforters, all be- \ndarned and ragged, and their beards stiff with icicles, \nthey seemed an eruption of bears from Labrador. They \nhad just landed from their boat, and this was the first \nhouse they entered. No wonder, then, that they made \na straight wake for the whale's mouth the bar when \nthe wrinkled little old Jonah, there officiating, soon \npoured them out brimmers all round. One complained \nof a bad cold in his head, upon which Jonah mixed \nhim a pitch-like potion of gin and molasses, which he \n\nVOL. I. B \n\n\n\n18 MOBY-DICK \n\nswore was a sovereign cure for all colds and catarrhs \nwhatsoever, never mind of how long standing, or whether \ncaught off the coast of Labrador, or on the weather-side \nof an ice -island. \n\nThe liquor soon mounted into their heads, as it \ngenerally does even with the arrantest topers newly \nlanded from sea, and they began capering about most \nobstreperously. \n\nI observed, however, that one of them held somewhat \naloof, and though he seemed desirous not to spoil the \nhilarity of his shipmates by his own sober face, yet upon \nthe whole he refrained from making as much noise as the \nrest. This man interested me at once ; and since the sea- \ngods had ordained that he should soon become my ship- \nmate (though but a sleeping-partner one, so far as this \nnarrative is concerned), I will here venture upon a little \ndescription of him. He stood full six feet in height, with \nnoble shoulders, and a chest like a coffer-dam. I have \nseldom seen such brawn in a man. His face was deeply \nbrown and burnt, making his white teeth dazzling by the \ncontrast ; while in the deep shadows of his eyes floated \nsome reminiscences that did not seem to give him much \njoy. His voice at once announced that he was a \nSoutherner, and from his fine stature, I thought he must \nbe one of those tall mountaineers from the Alleghanian \nRidge in Virginia. When the revelry of his companions \nhad mounted to its height, this man slipped away unob- \nserved, and I saw no more of him till he became my \ncomrade on the sea. In a few minutes, however, he was \nmissed by his shipmates, and being, it seems, for some \nreason a huge favourite with them, they raised a cry of \n' Bulkington ! Bulkington ! where 5 s Bulkington ? ' and \ndarted out of the house in pursuit of him. \n\nIt was now about nine o'clock, and the room seeming \nalmost supernaturally quiet after these orgies, I began \n\n\n\nTHE SPOUTER-INN 19 \n\nto congratulate myself upon a little plan that had occurred \nto me just previous to the entrance of the seamen. \n\nNo man prefers to sleep two in a bed. In fact, you \nwould a good deal rather not sleep with your own brother. \nI don't know how it is, but people like to be private when \nthey are sleeping. And when it comes to sleeping with \nan unknown stranger, in a strange inn, in a strange town, \nand that stranger a harpooneer, then your objections \nindefinitely multiply. Nor was there any earthly reason \nwhy I as a sailor should sleep two in a bed, more than \nanybody else ; for sailors no more sleep two in a bed at \nsea, than bachelor kings do ashore. To be sure, they \nall sleep together in one apartment, but you have your \nown hammock, and cover yourself with your own blanket, \nand sleep in your own skin. \n\nThe more I pondered over this harpooneer, the more I \nabominated the thought of sleeping with him. It was \nfair to presume that being a harpooneer, his linen or \nwoollen, as the case might be, would not be of the tidiest, \ncertainly none of the finest. I began to twitch all over. \nBesides, it was getting late, and my decent harpooneer \nought to be home and going bedward. Suppose now, \nhe should tumble in upon me at midnight how could I \ntell from what vile hole he had been coming ? \n\n' Landlord ! I Ve changed my mind about that \nharpooneer. I shan't sleep with him. I '11 try the bench \nhere.' \n\n' Just as you please ; I 'm sorry I can't spare ye a \ntablecloth for a mattress, and it 's a plaguy rough board \nhere ' feeling of the knots and notches. ' But wait \na bit, Skrimshander ; I Ve got a carpenter's plane there \nin the bar wait, I say, and I '11 make ye snug enough.' \nSo saying he procured the plane ; and with his old silk \nhandkerchief first dusting the bench, vigorously set to \nplaning away at my bed, the while grinning like an ape. \n\n\n\n20 MOBY-DICK \n\nThe shavings flew right and left ; till at last the plane- \niron came bump against an indestructible knot. The \nlandlord was near spraining his wrist, and I told him for \nheaven's sake to quit the bed was soft enough to suit \nme, and I did not know how all the planing in the world \ncould make eider down of a pine plank. So gathering \nup the shavings with another grin, and throwing them \ninto the great stove in the middle of the room, he went \nabout his business, and left me in a brown study. \n\nI now took the measure of the bench, and found that \nit was a foot too short ; but that could be mended with \na chair. But it was a foot too narrow, and the other \nbench in the room was about four inches higher than the \nplaned one so there was no yoking them. I then placed \nthe first bench lengthwise along the only clear space \nagainst the wall, leaving a little interval between, for my \nback to settle down in. But I soon found that there \ncame such a draught of cold air over me from under the \nsill of the window, that this plan would never do at all, \nespecially as another current from the rickety door met \nthe one from the window, and both together formed a \nseries of small whirlwinds in the immediate vicinity of the \nspot where I had thought to spend the night. \n\nThe devil fetch that harpooneer, thought I, but stop, \ncouldn't I steal a march on him bolt his door inside, and \njump into his bed, not to be wakened by the most violent \nknockings ? It seemed no bad idea ; but upon second \nthoughts I dismissed it. For who could tell but what \nthe next morning, so soon as I popped out of the room, \nthe harpooneer might be standing in the entry, all ready \nto knock me down ! \n\nStill, looking round me again, and seeing no possible \nchance of spending a sufferable night unless in some other \nperson's bed, I began to think that after all I might be \ncherishing unwarrantable prejudices against this unknown \n\n\n\nTHE SPOQTER-INN 21 \n\nharpooneer. Thinks I, I '11 wait awhile ; he must be \ndropping in before long. 1 11 have a good look at him \nthen, and perhaps we may become jolly good bedfellows \nafter all there 's no telling. \n\nBut though the other boarders kept coming in by \nones, twos, and threes, and going to bed, yet no sign of \nmy harpooneer. \n\n4 Landlord ! ' said I, ' what sort of a chap is he does \nhe always keep such late hours ? ' It was now hard \nupon twelve o'clock. \n\nThe landlord chuckled again with his lean chuckle, \nand seemed to be mightily tickled at something beyond \nmy comprehension. ' No,' he answered, ' generally he 5 s \nan early bird airley to bed and airley to rise yes, he 's \nthe bird what catches the worm. But to-night he \nwent out a-peddling, you see, and I don't see what \non airth keeps him so late, unless, maybe, he can't sell \nhis head.' \n\n' Can't sell his head ? What sort of a bamboozingly \nstory is this you are telling me ? ' getting into a tower- \ning rage. ' Do you pretend to say, landlord, that this \nharpooneer is actually engaged this blessed Saturday \nnight, or rather Sunday morning, in peddling his head \naround this town ? ' \n\n' That 's precisely it,' said the landlord, ' and I told \nhim he couldn't sell it here, the market 's overstocked.' \n\n' With what ? ' shouted I. \n\n' With heads, to be sure ; ain't there too many heads \nin the world ? ' \n\n' I tell you what it is, landlord,' said I, quite calmly, \n' you 'd better stop spinning that yarn to me I 'm not \ngreen.' \n\n6 Maybe not, ' taking out a stick and whittling a tooth- \npick, ' but I rayther guess you '11 be done brown if that \n'ere harpooneer hears you a-slanderin' his head.' \n\n\n\n22 MOBY-DICK \n\n' I '11 break it for him/ said I, now flying into a passion \nagain at this unaccountable farrago of the landlord's. \n\n' It 's broke a 'ready,' said he. \n\n' Broke/ said I ' broke, do you mean ? ' \n\n' Sartain, and that 's the very reason he can't sell it, \nI guess.' \n\n' Landlord/ said I, going up to him as cool as Mt. \nHecla in a snow-storm, 'landlord, stop whittling. You \nand I must understand one another, and that too without \ndelay. I come to your house and want a bed ; you tell \nme you can only give me half a one ; that the other half \nbelongs to a certain harpooneer. And about this har- \npooneer, whom I have not yet seen, you persist in telling \nme the most mystifying and exasperating stories, tending \nto beget in me an uncomfortable feeling toward the man \nwhom you design for my bedfellow* a sort of connection, \nlandlord, which is an intimate and confidential one in the \nhighest degree. I now demand of you to speak out and \ntell me who and what this harpooneer is, and whether I \nshall be in all respects safe to spend the night with him. \nAnd in the first place, you will be so good as to unsay that \nstory about selling his head, which if true I take to be \ngood evidence that this harpooneer is stark mad, and I 've \nno idea of sleeping with a madman ; and you, sir, you \nI mean, landlord, you, sir, by trying to induce me to do \nso knowingly, would thereby render yourself liable to a \ncriminal prosecution.' \n\n' Wall/ said the landlord, fetching a long breath, 'that 's \na purty long sarmon for a chap that rips a little now and \nthen. But be easy, be easy, this here harpooneer I have \nbeen tellin' you of has just arrived from the South Seas, \nwhere he bought up a lot of 'balmed New Zealand heads \n(great curios, you know), and he 's sold all on 'em but \none, and that one he 's tryin' to sell to-night, cause to- \nmorrow 's Sunday, and it would not do to be sellin' \n\n\n\nTHE SPOUTER-INN 23 \n\nhuman heads about the streets when folks is goin' to \nchurches. He wanted to, last Sunday, but I stopped him \njust as he was goin' out of the door with four heads strung \non a string, for all the airth like a string of inions.' \n\nThis account cleared up the otherwise unaccountable \nmystery, and showed that the landlord, after all, had had \nno idea of fooling me but at the same time what could \nI think of a harpooneer who stayed out of a Saturday \nnight clean into the holy Sabbath, engaged in such a \ncannibal business as selling the heads of dead idolaters ? \n\n' Depend upon it, landlord, that harpooneer is a danger- \nous man.' \n\n' He pays reg'lar, 5 was the rejoinder. ' But come, \nit 's getting dreadful late, you had better be turning \nflukes it 's a nice bed : Sail and me slept in that 'ere \nbed the night we were spliced. There 's plenty room for \ntwo to kick about in that bed ; it 's an almighty big bed \nthat. Why, afore we give it up, Sal used to put our Sam \nand little Johnny in the foot of it. But I got a-dreaming \nand sprawling about one night, and somehow, Sam got \npitched on the floor, and came near breaking his arm. \nArter that, Sal said it wouldn't do. Come along here, \nI '11 give ye a glim in a jiffy ' ; and so saying he lighted a \ncandle and held it toward me, offering to lead the way. \nBut I stood irresolute ; when looking at a clock in the \ncorner, he exclaimed, ' I vum it 's Sunday you won't \nsee that harpooneer to-night ; he 's come to anchor some- \nwhere come along then ; do come ; won't ye come ? ' \n\nI considered the matter a moment, and then upstairs \nwe went, and I was ushered into a small room, cold as a \nclam, and furnished, sure enough, with a prodigious bed, \nalmost big enough indeed for any four harpooneers to \nsleep abreast. \n\n' There,' said the landlord, placing the candle on a \ncrazy old sea-chest that did double duty as a wash-stand \n\n\n\n24 MOBY-DICK \n\nand centre table ; ' there, make yourself comfortable \nnow, and good night to ye.' I turned round from eyeing \nthe bed, but he had disappeared. \n\nFolding back the counterpane, I stooped over the bed. \nThough none of the most elegant, it yet stood the scrutiny \ntolerably well. I then glanced round the room ; and \nbesides the bedstead and centre table, could see no other \nfurniture belonging to the place, but a rude shelf, the four \nwalls, and a papered fire-board representing a man striking \na whale. Of things not properly belonging to the room, \nthere was a hammock lashed up, and thrown upon the \nfloor in one corner ; also a large seaman's bag, containing \nthe harpooneer's wardrobe, no doubt in lieu of a land trunk. \nLikewise, there was a parcel of outlandish bone fish-hooks \non the shelf over the fire-place, and a tall harpoon stand- \ning at the head of the bed. \n\nBut what is this on the chest ? I took it up, and held \nit close to the light, and felt it, and smelt it, and tried \nevery way possible to arrive at some satisfactory con- \nclusion concerning it. I can compare it to nothing but \na large door-mat, ornamented at the edges with little \ntinkling tags something like the stained porcupine quills \nround an Indian moccasin. There was a hole or slit in \nthe middle of this mat, as you see the same in South \nAmerican ponchos. But could it be possible that any \nsober harpooneer would get into a door-mat, and parade \nthe streets of any Christian town in that sort of guise ? \nI put it on, to try it, and it weighed me down like a hamper, \nbeing uncommonly shaggy and thick, and I thought a \nlittle damp, as though this mysterious harpooneer had \nbeen wearing it of a rainy day. I went up in it to a bit \nof glass stuck against the wall, and I never saw such a \nsight in my life. I tore myself out of it in such a hurry \nthat I gave myself a kink in the neck. \n\nI sat down on the side of the bed, and commenced \n\n\n\nTHE SPOUTER-INN 25 \n\nthinking about this head-peddling harpooneer, and his \ndoor-mat. After thinking some time on the bedside, I \ngot up and took off my monkey-jacket, and then stood \nin the middle of the room thinking. I then took off my \ncoat, and thought a little more in my shirt -sleeves. But \nbeginning to feel very cold now, half undressed as I was, \nand remembering what the landlord said about the har- \npooneer 's not coming home at all that night, it being so \nvery late, I made no more ado, but jumped out of my \npantaloons and boots, and then blowing out the light \ntumbled into bed, and commended myself to the care of \nheaven. \n\nWhether that mattress was stuffed with corn-cobs or \nbroken crockery, there is no telling, but I rolled about a \ngood deal, and could not sleep for a long time. At last \nI slid off into a light doze, and had pretty nearly made a \ngood offing toward the land of Nod, when I heard a \nheavy footfall in the passage, and saw a glimmer of light \ncome into the room from under the door. \n\nLord save me, thinks I, that must be the harpooneer, \nthe infemal head-peddler. But I lay perfectly still, and \nresolved not to say a word till spoken to. Holding a \nlight in one hand, and that identical New Zealand head \nin the other, the stranger entered the room, and without \nlooking toward the bed, placed his candle a good way \noff from me on the floor in one corner, and then began \nworking away at the knotted cords of the large bag I \nbefore spoke of as being in the room. I was all eagerness \nto see his face, but he kept it averted for some time while \nemployed in unlacing the bag 's mouth . This accomplished, \nhowever, he turned round when, good heavens ! what a \nsight ! Such a face ! It was of a dark, purplish, yellow \ncolour, here and there stuck over with large, blackish- \nlooking squares. Yes, it 's just as I thought, he 's a \nterrible bedfellow ; he 's been in a fight, got dreadfully \n\n\n\n26 MOBY-DICK \n\ncut, and here he is, just from the surgeon. But at that \nmoment he chanced to turn his face so toward the light, \nthat I plainly saw they could not be sticking-plasters at \nall, those black squares on his cheeks. They were stains \nof some sort or other. At first I knew not what to make \nof this ; but soon an inkling of the truth occurred to me. \nI remembered a story of a white man a whaleman too \nwho, falling among the cannibals, had been tattooed by \nthem. I concluded that this harpooneer, in the course of \nhis distant voyages, must have met with a similar adven- \nture. And what is it, thought I, after all ! It 's only \nhis outside ; a man can be honest in any sort of skin. \nBut then, what to make of his unearthly complexion, \nthat part of it, I mean, lying round about, and completely \nindependent of the squares of tattooing. To be sure, it \nmight be nothing but a good coat of tropical tanning ; \nbut I never heard of a hot sun's tanning a white man into \na purplish-yellow one. However, I had never been in \nthe South Seas ; and perhaps the sun there produced \nthese extraordinary effects upon the skin. Now, while \nall these ideas were passing through me like lightning, \nthis harpooneer never noticed me at all. But, after some \ndifficulty having opened his bag, he commenced fumbling \nin it, and presently pulled out a sort of tomahawk, and \na sealskin wallet with the hair on. Placing these on the \nold chest in the middle of the room, he then took the New \nZealand head a ghastly thing enough and crammed it \ndown into the bag. He now took off his hat a new \nbeaver hat when I came nigh singing out with fresh \nsurprise. There was no hair on his head none to speak \nof, at least nothing but a small scalp -knot twisted up on \nhis forehead. His bald purplish head now looked for \nall the world like a mildewed skull. Had not the^stranger \nstood between me and the door, I would have bolted out \nof it quicker than ever I bolted a dinner. \n\n\n\nTHE SPOUTER-INN 27 \n\nEven as it was, I thought something of slipping out \nof the window, but it was the second floor back. I am \nno coward, but what to make of this head-peddling purple \nrascal altogether passed my comprehension. Ignorance, \njs^the parent^QJJear, and being completely nonplussed \nand confounded about the stranger, I confess I was now \nas much afraid of him as if it was the devil himself who \nhad thus broken into my room at the dead of night. In \nfact, I was so afraid of him that I was not game enough \njust then to address him, and demand a satisfactory \nanswer concerning what seemed inexplicable in him. \n\nMeanwhile, he continued the business of undressing, \nand at last showed his chest and arms. As I live, these \ncovered parts of him were checkered with the same \nsquares as his face ; his back, too, was all over the same \ndark squares ; he seemed to have been in a Thirty Years' \nWar, and just escaped from it with a sticking-plaster shirt. \nStill more, his very legs were marked, as if a parcel of \ndark green frogs were running up the trunks of young \npalms. It was now quite plain that he must be some \nabominable savage or other shipped aboard of a whale- \nman in the South Seas, and so landed in this Christian \ncountry. I quaked to think of it. A peddler of heads too \nperhaps the heads of his own brothers. He might take \na fancy to mine heavens ! look at that tomahawk ! \n\nBut there was no time for shuddering, for now the \nsavage went about something that completely fascinated \nmy attention, and convinced me that he must indeed be \na heathen. Going to his heavy grego, or wrapall, or \ndreadnaught, which he had previously hung on a chair, \nhe fumbled in the pockets, and produced at length a \ncurious little deformed image with a hunch on its back, \nand exactly the colour of a three-days-old Congo baby. \nRemembering the embalmed head, at first I almost \nthought that this black manikin was a real baby pre- \n\n\n\n28 MOBY-DICK \n\nserved in some similar manner. But seeing that it was \nnot at all limber, and that it glistened a good deal like \npolished ebony, I concluded that it must be nothing but \na wooden idol, which indeed it proved to be. For now \nthe savage goes up to the empty fire-place, and removing \nthe papered fire -board, sets up this little hunchbacked \nimage, like a ten-pin, between the andirons. The chimney \njambs and all the bricks inside were very sooty, so that \nI thought this fire-place made a very appropriate little \nshrine or chapel for his Congo idol. \n\nI now screwed my eyes hard toward the half-hidden \nimage, feeling but ill at ease meantime to see what was \nnext to follow. First he takes about a double handful \nof shavings out of his grego pocket, and places them \ncarefully before the idol ; then laying a bit of ship -biscuit \non top and applying the flame from the lamp, he kindled \n\u003cthe shavings into a sacrificial blaze. Presently, after \nmany hasty snatches into the fire, and still hastier with- \ndrawals of his fingers (whereby he seemed to be scorching \nthem badly), he at last succeeded in drawing out the \nbiscuit ; then blowing off the heat and ashes a little, \nhe made a polite offer of it to the little negro. But the \nlittle devil did not seem to fancy such dry sort of fare at \nall ; he never moved his lips. All these strange antics \nwere accompanied by still stranger guttural noises from \nthe devotee, who seemed to be praying in a sing-song \nor else singing some pagan psalmody or other, during \nwhich his face twitched about in the most unnatural \nmanner. At last, extinguishing the fire, he took the idol \nup very unceremoniously, and bagged it again in his \ngrego pocket as carelessly as if he were a sportsman \nbagging a dead woodcock. \n\nAll these queer proceedings increased my uncomf ortable- \nness, and seeing him now exhibiting strong symptoms of \nconcluding his business operations, and jumping into bed \n\n\n\nTHE SPOUTER-INN 29 \n\nwith me, I thought it was high time, now or never, before \nthe light was put out, to break the spell in which I had \nso long been bound. \n\nBut the interval I spent in deliberating what to say \nwas a fatal one. Taking up his tomahawk from the table, \nhe examined the head of it for an instant, and then hold- \ning it to the light, with his mouth at the handle, he puffed \nout great clouds of tobacco smoke. The next moment \nthe light was extinguished, and this wild cannibal, toma- \nhawk between his teeth, sprang into bed with me. I \nsang out, I could not help it now ; and giving a sudden \ngrunt of astonishment he began feeling me. \n\nStammering out something, I knew not what, I rolled \naway from him against the wall, and then conjured him, \nwhoever or whatever he might be, to keep quiet, and let \nme get up and light the lamp again. But his guttural \nresponses satisfied me at once that he but ill compre- \nhended my meaning. \n\n' Who-e debel you ? ' he at last said ' you no speak-e, \ndam-me, I kill-e.' And so saying the lighted tomahawk \nbegan flourishing about me in the dark. \n\n4 Landlord, for God's sake, Peter Coffin ! ' shouted I. \n' Landlord ! Watch ! Coffin ! Angels ! save me ! ' \n\n1 Speak-e ! tell-ee me who-ee be, or dam-me, I kill-e ! ' \nagain growled the cannibal, while his horrid flourishings \nof the tomahawk scattered the hot tobacco ashes about \nme till I thought my linen would get on fire. But thank \nheaven, at that moment the landlord came into the room \nlight in hand, and leaping from the bed I ran up to him. \n\n4 Don't be afraid now,' said he, grinning again. ' Quee- \nqueg here wouldn't harm a hair of your head.' \n\n' Stop your grinning,' shouted I, ' and why didn't you \ntell me that that infernal harpooneer was a cannibal ? ' \n\n' I thought ye know'd it ; didn't I tell ye, he was \na-peddlin' heads around town ? but turn flukes again \n\n\n\n30 MOBY-DICK \n\nand go to sleep. Queequeg, look here you sabbee me, \nI sabbee you this man sleepe you you sabbee ? ' \n\n' Me sabbee plenty,' grunted Queequeg, puffing away \nat his pipe and sitting up in bed. \n\n' You gettee in/ he added, motioning to me with his \ntomahawk, and throwing the clothes to one side. He \nreally did this in not only a civil but a really kind and \ncharitable way. I stood looking at him a moment. For \nall his tattooings he was on the whole a clean, comely- \nlooking cannibal. What 's all this fuss I have been \nmaking about, thought I to myself the man ? s a human \nbeing just as I am : he has just as much reason to fear \nme, as I have to be afraid of him. Better sleep with a \nsober cannibal than a drunken Christian. \n\n'Landlord,' said I, 'tell him to stash his tomahawk \nthere, or pipe, or whatever you call it ; tell him to stop \nsmoking, in short, and I will turn in with him. But I \ndon't fancy having a man smoking in bed with me. It 's \ndangerous. Besides, I ain't insured.' \n\nThis being told to Queequeg, he at once complied, and \nagain politely motioned me to get into bed rolling over \nto one side as much as to say, I won't touch a leg of ye. \n\n' Good night, landlord,' said I, ' you may go.' \n\nI turned in, and never slept better in my life. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV \n\nTHE COUNTERPANE \n\nUPON waking next morning about daylight, I found \nQueequeg's arm thrown over me in the most loving and \naffectionate manner. You had almost thought I had \nbeen his wife. The counterpane was of patchwork, full \nof odd little parti-coloured squares and triangles ; and \nthis arm of his tattooed all over with an interminable \nCretan labyrinth of a figure, no two parts of which were \nof one precise shade owing, I suppose, to his keeping \nhis arm at sea unmethodically in sun and shade, his \nshirt-sleeves irregularly rolled up at various times \nthis same arm of his, I say, looked for all the world like \na strip of that same patchwork quilt. Indeed, partly \nlying on it as the arm did when I first awoke, I could \nhardly tell it from the quilt, they so blended their hues \ntogether ; and it was only by the sense of weight and \npressure that I could tell that Queequeg was hugging me. \nMy sensations were strange. Let me try to explain \nthem. When I was a child, I well remember a somewhat \nsimilar circumstance that befell me ; whether it was a \nreality or a dream, I never could entirely settle. The \ncircumstance was this. I had been cutting up some \ncaper or other I think it was trying to crawl up the \nchimney, as I had seen a little sweep do a few days \nprevious ; and my stepmother, who, somehow or other, \nwas all the time whipping me, or sending me to bed \nsupperless, my mother dragged me by the legs out \nof the chimney and packed me off to bed, though it was \nonly two o'clock in the afternoon of the 21st June, the \n\n31 \n\n\n\n32 MOBY-DICK \n\nlongest day in the year in our hemisphere. 1 felt dread- \nfully. But there was no help for it, so upstairs I went \nto my little room in the third floor, undressed myself as \nslowly as possible so as to kill time, and with a bitter \nsigh got between the sheets. \n\nI lay there dismally calculating that sixteen entire \nhours must elapse before I could hope for a resurrection. \nSixteen hours in bed ! the small of my back ached to \nthink of it. And it was so light too ; the sun shining \nin at the window, and a great rattling of coaches in the \nstreets, and the sound of gay voices all over the house. \nI felt worse and worse at last I got up, dressed, and \nsoftly going down in my stockinged feet, sought out my \nstepmother, and suddenly threw myself at her feet, be- \nseeching her as a particular favour to give me a good \nslippering for my misbehaviour ; anything indeed but con- \ndemning me to lie abed such an unendurable length of \ntime. But she was the best and most conscientious of \nstepmothers, and back I had to go to my room. For \nseveral hours I lay there broad awake, feeling a great \ndeal worse than I have ever done since, even from the \ngreatest subsequent misfortunes. At last I must have \nfallen into a troubled nightmare of a doze ; and slowly \nwaking from it half steeped in dreams I opened my \neyes, and the before sunlit room was now wrapped in \nouter darkness. Instantly I felt a shock running through \nall my frame ; nothing was to be seen, and nothing was \nto be heard ; but a supernatural hand seemed placed \nin mine. My arm hung over the counterpane, and the \nnameless, unimaginable, silent form or phantom, to which \nthe hand belonged, seemed closely seated by my bedside. \nFor what seemed ages piled on ages, I lay there, frozen \nwith the most awful fears, not daring to drag away my \nhand ; yet ever thinking that if I could but stir it one \nsingle inch, the horrid spell would be broken. I knew \n\n\n\nTHE COUNTERPANE 33 \n\nnot how this consciousness at last glided away from me ; \nbut waking in the morning, I shudderingly remembered \nit all, and for days and weeks and months afterward I \nlost myself in confounding attempts to explain the mystery. \nNay, to this very hour, I often puzzle myself with it. \n\nNow, take away the awful fear, and my sensations at \nfeeling the supernatural hand in mine were very similar, \nin their strangeness, to those which I experienced on \nwaking up and seeing Queequeg 's pagan arm thrown \nround me. But at length all the past night's events \nsoberly recurred, one by one, in fixed reality, and then I \nlay only alive to the comical predicament. For though \nI tried to move his arm unlock his bridegroom clasp \nyet, sleeping as he was, he still hugged me tightly, as \nthough naught but death should part us twain. I now \nstrove to rouse him * Queequeg ! ' but his only answer \nwas a snore. I then rolled over, my neck feeling as if \nit were in a horse-collar ; and suddenly felt a slight \nscratch. Throwing aside the counterpane, there lay the \ntomahawk sleeping by the savage's side, as if it were a \nhatchet -faced baby. A pretty pickle, truly, thought I ; \nabed here in a strange house in the broad day, with a \ncannibal and a tomahawk ! ' Queequeg ! in the name \nof goodness, Queequeg, wake ! ' At length, by dint of \nmuch wriggling, and loud and incessant expostulations \nupon the unbecomingness of his hugging a fellow-male in \nthat matrimonial sort of style, I succeeded in extracting \na grunt ; and presently, he drew back his arm, shook \nhimself all over like a Newfoundland dog just from the \nwater, and sat up in bed, stiff as a pikestaff, looking at \nme, and rubbing his eyes as if he did not altogether re- \nmember how I came to be there, though a dim conscious- \nness of knowing something about me seemed slowly \ndawning over him. Meanwhile, I lay quietly eyeing him, \nhaving no serious misgivings now, and bent upon narrowly \n\nVOL. i. c \n\n\n\n34 MOBY-DICK \n\nobserving so curious a creature. When, at last, his mind \nseemed made up touching the character of his bed- \nfellow, and he became, as it were, reconciled to the fact, \nhe jumped out upon the floor, and by certain signs and \nsounds gave me to understand that, if it pleased me, he \nwould dress first and then leave me to dress afterward, \nleaving the whole apartment to myself. Thinks I, \nQueequeg, under the circumstances, this is a very civilised \noverture ; but, the truth is, these savages have an innate \nsense of delicacy, say what you will ; it is marvellous how \nessentially polite they are. I pay this particular compli- \nment to Queequeg, because he treated me with so much \ncivility and consideration, while I was guilty of great \nrudeness ; staring at him from the bed, and watching all \nhis toilet motions ; for the time my curiosity getting the \nbetter of my breeding. Nevertheless, a man like Quee- \nqueg you don't see every day, he and his ways were well \nworth unusual regarding. \n\nHe commenced dressing at top by donning his beaver \nhat, a very tall one, by the by, and then still minus his \ntrowsers he hunted up his boots. What under the \nheavens he did it for, I cannot tell, but his next movement \nwas to crush himself boots in hand, and hat on under \nthe bed ; when, from sundry violent gaspings and strain- \nings, I inferred he was hard at work booting himself ; \nthough by no law of propriety that I ever heard of is \nany man required to be private when putting on his boots. \nBut Queequeg, do you see, was a creature in the transi- \ntion state neither caterpillar nor butterfly. He was \njust enough civilised to show off his outlandishness in the \nstrangest possible manner. His education was not yet \ncompleted. He was an undergraduate. If he had not \nbeen a small degree civilised, he very probably would \nnot have troubled himself with boots at all ; but then, \nif he had not been still a savage, he never would have \n\n\n\nTHE COUNTERPANE 35 \n\ndreamt of getting under the bed to put them on. At \nlast, he emerged with his hat very much dented and \ncrushed down over his eyes, and began creaking and \nlimping about the room, as if, not being much accustomed \nto boots, his pair of damp, wrinkled cowhide ones pro- \nbably not made to order either rather pinched and \ntormented him at the first go off of a bitter cold morning. \n\nSeeing, now, that there were no curtains to the window, \nand that the street being very narrow, the house opposite \ncommanded a plain view into the room, and observing \nmore and more the indecorous figure that Queequeg \nmade, staving about with little else but his hat and boots \non, I begged him as well as I could, to accelerate his \ntoilet somewhat, and particularly to get into his panta- \nloons as soon as possible. He complied, and then pro- \nceeded to wash himself. At that time in the morning \nany Christian would have washed his face ; but Queequeg, \nto my amazement, contented himself with restricting \nhis ablutions to his chest, arms, and hands. He then \ndonned his waistcoat, and taking up a piece of hard soap \non the wash-stand centre table, dipped it into water and \ncommenced lathering his face. I was watching to see \nwhere he kept his razor, when lo and behold, he takes the \nharpoon from the bed corner, slips out the long wooden \nstock, unsheathes the head, whets it a little on his boot, \nand striding up to the bit of mirror against the wall, \nbegins a vigorous scraping, or rather harpooning of his \ncheeks. Thinks I, Queequeg, this is using Rogers's best \ncutlery with a vengeance. Afterward I wondered the \nless at this operation when I came to know of what \nfine steel the head of a harpoon is made, and how \nexceedingly sharp the long straight edges are always kept. \n\nThe rest of his toilet was soon achieved, and he proudly \nmarched out of the room, wrapped up in his great pilot \nmonkey-jacket, and sporting his harpoon like a marshal's \nbaton. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER V \n\nBREAKFAST \n\nI QUICKLY followed suit, and descending into the bar-room \naccosted the grinning landlord very pleasantly. I \ncherished no malice toward him, though he had been \nskylarking with me not a little in the matter of my \nbedfellow. \n\nHowever, a good laugh is a mighty good thing, and \nrather too scarce a good thing ; the more 's the pity. So, \nif any one man, in his own proper person, afford stuff for \na good joke to anybody, let him not be backward, but let \nhim cheerfully allow himself to spend and be spent in \nthat way. And the man that has anything bountifully \nlaughable about him, be sure there is more in that man \nthan you perhaps think for. \n\nThe bar-room was now full of the boarders who had been \ndropping in the night previous, and whom I had not as \nyet had a good look at. They were nearly all whalemen ; \nchief mates, and second mates, and third mates, and sea- \ncarpenters, and sea-coopers, and sea-blacksmiths, and \nharpooneers, and ship-keepers ; a brown and brawny \ncompany, with bosky beards ; an unshorn, shaggy set, \nall wearing monkey-jackets for morning gowns. \n\nYou could pretty plainly tell how long each one had \nbeen ashore. This young fellow's healthy cheek is like \na sun-toasted pear in hue, and would seem to smell \nalmost as musky ; he cannot have been three days landed \nfrom his Indian voyage. That man next him looks a \nfew shades lighter ; you might say a touch of satinwood \n\n36 \n\n\n\nBREAKFAST 37 \n\nis in him. In the complexion of a third still lingers a \ntropic tawn, but slightly bleached withal ; lie doubtless \nhas tarried whole weeks ashore. But who could show a \ncheek like Queequeg ? which, barred with various tints, \nseemed like the Andes' western slope, to show forth in \none array, contrasting climates, zone by zone. \n\n' Grub, ho ! ' now cried the landlord, flinging open a \ndoor, and in we went to breakfast. \n\nThey say that men who have seen the world, thereby \nbecome quite at ease in manner, quite self-possessed in \ncompany. Not always, though : Ledyard, the great New \nEngland traveller, and Mungo Park, the Scotch one ; of \nall men, they possessed the least assurance in the parlour. \nBut perhaps the mere crossing of Siberia in a sledge \ndrawn by dogs as Ledyard did, or the taking a long solitary \nwalk on an empty stomach, in the negro heart of Africa, \nwhich was the sum of poor Mungo 's performances this \nkind of travel, I say, may not be the very best mode of \nattaining a high social polish. Still, for the most part, \nthat sort of thing is to be had anywhere. \n\nThese reflections just here are occasioned by the cir- \ncumstance that after we were all seated at the table, and \nI was preparing to hear some good stories about whaling ; \nto my no small surprise nearly every man maintained a \nprofound silence. And not only that, but they looked \nembarrassed. Yes, here were a set of sea-dogs, many of \nwhom without the slightest bashfulness had boarded \ngreat whales on the high seas entire strangers to them \nand duelled them dead without winking ; and yet, here \nthey sat at a social breakfast table all of the same calling, \nall of kindred tastes looking round as sheepishly at \neach other as though they had never been out of sight \nof some sheepfold among the Green Mountains. A \ncurious sight ; these bashful bears, these timid warrior \nwhalemen ! \n\n\n\n38 MOBY-DICK \n\nBut as for Queequeg why, Queequeg sat there among \nthem at the head of the table, too, it so chanced as \ncool as an icicle. To be sure, I cannot say much for his \nbreeding. His greatest admirer could not have cordially \njustified his bringing his harpoon in to breakfast with him, \nand using it there without ceremony ; reaching over the \ntable with it, to the imminent jeopardy of many heads, \nand grappling the beefsteaks toward him. But that \nwas certainly very coolly done by him, and everyone \nknows that in most people's estimation, to do anything \ncoolly is to do it genteelly. \n\nWe will not speak of all Queequeg's peculiarities here ; \nhow he eschewed coffee and hot rolls, and applied his \nundivided attention to beefsteaks, done rare. Enough, \nthat when breakfast was over he withdrew like the rest \ninto the public room, lighted his tomahawk-pipe, and was \nsitting there quietly digesting and smoking with his \ninseparable hat on, when I sallied out for a stroll. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI \n\nTHE STREET \n\nIF I had been astonished at first catching a glimpse of so \noutlandish an individual as Queequeg circulating among \nthe polite society of a civilised town, that astonishment \nsoon departed upon taking my first daylight stroll through \nthe streets of New Bedford. \n\nIn thoroughfares nigh the docks, any considerable sea- \nport will frequently offer to view the queerest -looking \nnondescripts from foreign parts. Even in Broadway \nand Chestnut Streets, Mediterranean mariners will some- \ntimes jostle the affrighted ladies. Regent Street is not \nunknown to Lascars and Malays ; and at Bombay, in the \nApollo Green, live Yankees have often scared the natives. \nBut New Bedford beats all Water Street and Wapping. \nIn these last -mentioned haunts you see only sailors ; but \nin New Bedford actual cannibals stand chatting at street \ncorners ; savages outright ; many of whom yet carry on \ntheir bones unholy flesh. It makes a stranger stare. \n\nBut, besides the Feegeeans, Tongatabooarrs, Erro- \nmanggoans, Pannangians, and Brighggians, and besides \nthe wild specimens of the whaling -craft which unheeded \nreel about the streets, you will see other sights still more \ncurious, certainly more comical. There weekly arrive \nin this town scores of green Vermonters and New Hamp- \nshire men, all athirst for gain and glory in the fishery. \nThey are mostly young, of stalwart frames ; fellows who \nhave felled forests, and now seek to drop the axe and \nsnatch the whale-lance. Many are as green as the Green \n\n\n\n40 MOBY-DICK \n\nMountains whence they came. In some things you would \nthink them but a few hours old. Look there ! that chap \nstrutting round the corner. He wears a beaver hat and \nswallow-tailed coat, girdled with a sailor -belt and a sheath- \nknife. Here comes another with a sou '-wester and a \nbombazine cloak. \n\nNo town-bred dandy will compare with a country-bred \none I mean a downright bumpkin dandy a fellow that, \nin the dog-days, will mow his two acres in buckskin \ngloves for fear of tanning his hands. Now when a country \ndandy like this takes it into his head to make a distin- \nguished reputation, and joins the great whale-fishery, you \nshould see the comical things he does upon reaching the \nseaport. In bespeaking his sea -out fit, he orders bell- \nbuttons to his waistcoats ; straps to his canvas trowsers. \nAh, poor Hay-Seed ! how bitterly will burst those straps \nin the first howling gale, when thou art driven, straps/ \nbuttons, and all, down the throat of the tempest. \n\nBut think not that this famous town has only har- \npooneers, cannibals, and bumpkins to show her visitors. \nNot at all. Still New Bedford is a queer place. Had it \nnot been for us whalemen, that tract of land would this \nday perhaps have been in as howling condition as the \ncoast of Labrador. As it is, parts of her back country \nare enough to frighten one, they look so bony. The town \nitself is perhaps the dearest place to live in, hi all New \nEngland. It is a land of oil, true enough : but not like \nCaanan ; a land, also, of corn and wine. The streets do \nnot run with milk ; nor in the spring-time do they pave \nthem with fresh eggs. Yet, in spite of this, nowhere in \nall America will you find more patrician-like houses ; \nparks and gardens more opulent, than hi New Bedford. \nWhence came they ? how planted upon this once scraggy \nscoria of a country ? \n\nGo and gaze upon the iron emblematical harpoons \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE STREET 41 \n\nround yonder lofty mansion, and your question will be \nanswered. Yes ; all these brave houses and flowery \ngardens came from the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian oceans. \nOne and all, they were harpooned and dragged up hither \nfrom the bottom of the sea. Can Herr Alexander per- \nform a feat like that ? \n\nIn New Bedford, fathers, they say, give whales for \ndowers to their daughters, and portion off their nieces \nwith a few porpoises apiece. You must go to New Bed- \nford to see a brilliant wedding ; for, they say, they have \nreservoirs of oil in every house, and every night recklessly \nburn their lengths in spermaceti candles. \n\nIn summer time, the town is sweet to see ; full of fine \nmaples long avenues of green and gold. And in August, \nhigh in air, the beautiful and bountiful horse-chestnuts, \ncandelabra-wise, proffer the passer-by their tapering \nupright cones of congregated blossoms. So omnipotent \\ \nis art ; which in many a district of New Bedford has \nsuperinduced bright terraces of flowers upon the barren \nrefuse rocks thrown aside at Creation's final day. \n\nAnd the women of New Bedford, they bloom like their \nown red roses. But roses only bloom in summer ; whereas \nthe fine carnation of their cheeks is perennial as sunlight \nin the seventh heavens. Elsewhere match that bloom \nof theirs, ye cannot, save in Salem, where they tell me \nthe young girls breathe such musk, their sailor sweet- \nhearts smell them miles off shore, as though they were \ndrawing nigh the odorous Moluccas instead of the Puritanic \nsands. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII \n\nTHE CHAPEL \n\nIN this same New Bedford there stands a Whaleman's \nChapel, and few are the moody fishermen, shortly bound \nfor the Indian Ocean or Pacific, who fail to make a Sunday \nvisit to the spot. I am sure that I did not. \n\nReturning from my first morning stroll, I again sallied \nout upon this special errand. The sky had changed from \nclear, sunny cold, to driving sleet and mist. Wrapping \nmyself in my shaggy jacket of the cloth called bearskin, \nI fought my way against the stubborn storm. Entering, \nI found a small scattered congregation of sailors, and \nsailors' wives and widows. A muffled silence reigned, \nonly broken at times by the shrieks of the storm. Each \nsilent worshipper seemed purposely sitting apart from \nthe other, as if each silent grief were insular and incom- \nmunicable. The chaplain had not yet arrived ; and there \nthese silent islands of men and women sat steadfastly \neyeing several marble tablets, with black borders, masoned \ninto the wall on either side the pulpit. Three of them \nran something like the following, but I do not pretend to \nquote : \n\nSACRED \n\n\n\nOF \n\nJOHN TALBOT, \n\nWho, at the age of eighteen, was lost overboard, \n\nNear the Isle of Desolation, off Patagonia, \n\nNovember 1st, 1836. \n\nTHIS TABLET \n\nIs erected to his Memory \n\nBY HIS SISTER. \n\n\n\n42 \n\n\n\nTHE CHAPEL 43 \n\nSACRED \n\n^o tlje em orp \n\nOF \n\nROBERT LONG, WILLIS ELLERY, \n\nNATHAN COLEMAN, WALTER CANNY, SETH MACY, \n\nAND SAMUEL GLEIG, \n\nForming one of the boats' crews \nOF \n\nTHE SHIP ELIZA, \n\nWho were towed out of sight by a Whale, \nOn the Ofi-shore Ground in the \n\nPACIFIC, \nDecember 3lst, 1839. \n\nTHIS MABBLB \n\nIs here placed by their surviving \nShipmates \n\n\n\nSACKED \n\nEo tfje \n\nOF \n\nThe late \n\nCAPTAIN EZEKIEL HARDY, \n\nWho in the bows of his boat was killed by a \n\nSperm Whale on the coast of Japan, \n\nAugust 3d, 1833. \n\nTHIS TABLET \n\nIs erected to his Memory \nBY \n\nHIS WIDOW. \n\nShaking off the sleet from my ice-glazed hat and jacket, \nI seated myself near the door, and turning sideways was \nsurprised to see Queequeg near me. Affected by the \nsolemnity of the scene, there was a wondering gaze of \nincredulous curiosity in his countenance. This savage \nwas the only person present who seemed to notice my \nentrance ; because he was the only one who could not \nread, and, therefore, was not reading those frigid inscrip- \ntions on the wall. Whether any of the relatives of the \n\n\n\n44 MOBY-DICK \n\nseamen whose names appeared there were now among \nthe congregation, I knew not ; but so many are the unre- \ncorded accidents in the fishery, and so plainly did several \nwomen present wear the countenance if not the trappings \nof some unceasing grief, that I feel sure that here before \nme were assembled those, in whose unhealing hearts the \nsight of those bleak tablets sympathetically caused the \nold wounds to bleed afresh. \n\nOh ! ye whose dead lie buried beneath the green grass ; \nwho standing among flowers can say here, here lies my \nbeloved ; ye know not the desolation that broods in \nbosoms like these. What bitter blanks in those black- \nbordered marbles which cover no ashes ! What despair \nin those immovable inscriptions ! What deadly voids \nand unbidden infidelities in the lines that seem to gnaw \nupon all Faith, and refuse resurrections to the beings who \nhave placelessly perished without a grave. As well might \nthose tablets stand in the cave of Elephanta as here. \n\nLi what census of living creatures, the dead of mankind \nare included ; why it is that a universal proverb says of \nthem, that they tell no tales, though containing more \nsecrets than the Goodwin Sands ; how it is that to his \nname who yesterday departed for the other world, we \nprefix so significant and infidel a word, and yet do not \nthus entitle him, if he but embarks for the remotest Indies \nof this living earth ; why the Life Insurance Companies \npay death-forfeitures upon immortals ; in what eternal, \nunstirring paralysis, and deadly, hopeless trance, yet lies \nantique Adam who died sixty round centuries ago ; how \nit is that we still refuse to be comforted for those who we \nnevertheless maintain are dwelling in unspeakable bliss ; \nwhy all the living so strive to hush all the dead ; wherefore \nbut the rumour of a knocking in a tomb will terrify a \nwhole city. All these things are not without their \nmeanings. \n\n\n\nTHE CHAPEL 45 \n\nBut Faith, like a jackal, feeds among the tombs, and \neven from these dead doubts she gathers her most vital \nhope. \n\nIt needs scarcely to be told, with what feelings, on the \neve of a Nantucket voyage, I regarded those marble \ntablets, and by the murky light of that darkened, doleful \nday read the fate of the whalemen who had gone before \nme. Yes, Ishmael, the same fate may be thine. But \nsomehow I grew merry again. Delightful inducements to \nembark, fine chance for promotion, it seems ay, a \nstove boat will make me an immortal by brevet. Yes, \nthere is death in this business of whaling a speechlessly \nquick chaotic bundling of a man into Eternity. But what \nthen ? Methinks we have hugely mistaken this matter \nof Life and Death. Methinks that what they call my \nshadow here on earth is my true substance. Methinks \nthat in looking at things spiritual, we are too much like \noysters observing the sun through the water, and thinking \nthat thick water the thinnest of air. Methinks my body \nis but the lees of my better being. In fact, take my body \nwho will, take it I say, it is not me. And therefore three \ncheers for Nantucket ; and come a stove boat and stove \nbody when they will, for stave my soul, Jove himself \ncannot. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII \n\nTHE PULPIT \n\nI HAD not been seated very long ere a man of a certain \nvenerable robustness entered ; immediately as the storm- \npelted door flew back upon admitting him, a quick regard- \nful eyeing of him by all the congregation sufficiently \nattested that this fine old man was the chaplain. Yes, \nit was the famous Father Mapple, so called by the whale- \nmen, among whom he was a very great favourite. He \nhad been a sailor and a harpooneer in his youth, but for \nmany years past had dedicated his life to the ministry. \nAt the time I now write of, Father Mapple was in the \nhardy winter of a healthy old age ; that sort of old age \nwhich seems merging into a second flowering youth, for \namong all the fissures of his wrinkles, there shone certain \nmild gleams of a newly developing bloom the spring \nverdure peeping forth even beneath February's snow. \nNo one having previously heard his history, could for \nthe first time behold Father Mapple without the utmost \ninterest, because there were certain engrafted clerical \npeculiarities about him, imputable to that adventurous \nmaritime life he had led. When he entered I observed \nthat he carried no umbrella, and certainly had not come \nin his carriage, for his tarpaulin hat ran down with melting \nsleet, and his great pilot-cloth jacket seemed almost to \ndrag him to the floor with the weight of the water it had \nabsorbed. However, hat and coat and overshoes were \none by one removed, and hung up in a little space in an \nadjacent corner ; when, arrayed in a decent suit, he \nquietly approached the pulpit. \n\n46 \n\n\n\nTHE PULPIT 47 \n\nLike most old-fashioned pulpits, it was a very lofty one, \nand since a regular stairs to such a height would, by its \nlong angle with the floor, seriously contract the already \nsmall area of the chapel, the architect, it seemed, had \nacted upon the hint of Father Mapple, and finished the \npulpit without a stairs, substituting a perpendicular side \nladder, like those used in mounting a ship from a boat at \nsea. The wife of a whaling-captain had provided the chapel \nwith a handsome pair of red worsted man-ropes for this \nladder, which, being itself nicely headed, and stained with \na mahogany colour, the whole contrivance, considering \nwhat manner of chapel it was, seemed by no means in bad \ntaste. Halting for an instant at the foot of the ladder, \nand with both hands grasping the ornamental knobs \nof the man-ropes, Father Mapple cast a look upward, \nand then with a truly sailor-like but still reverential \ndexterity, hand over hand, mounted the steps as if \nascending the main -top of his vessel. \n\nThe perpendicular parts of this side ladder, as is usually \nthe case with swinging ones, were of cloth-covered rope, \nonly the rounds were of wood, so that at every step there \nwas a joint. At my first glimpse of the pulpit, it had not \nescaped me that however convenient for a ship, these \njoints in the present instance seemed unnecessary. For \nI was not prepared to see Father Mapple after gaining \nthe height, slowly turn round, and stooping over the \npulpit, deliberately drag up the ladder step by step, till \nthe whole was deposited within, leaving him impregnable \nin his little Quebec. \n\nI pondered some time without fully comprehending \nthe reason for this. Father Mapple enjoyed such a wide \nreputation for sincerity and sanctity, that I could not \nsuspect him of courting notoriety by any mere tricks of \nthe stage. No, thought I, there must be some sober \nreason for this thing ; furthermore, it must symbolise \n\n\n\n48 MOBY-DICK \n\nsomething unseen. Can it be, then, that by that act of \nphysical isolation, he signifies his spiritual withdrawal for \nthe time, from all outward worldly ties and connections ? \nYes, for replenished with the meat and wine of the word, \nto the faithful man of God, this pulpit, I see, is a self- \ncontaining stronghold a lofty Ehrenbreitstein, with a \nperennial well of water within the walls. \n\nBut the side ladder was not the only strange feature \nof the place, borrowed from the chaplain's former sea- \nfarings. Between the marble cenotaphs on either hand \nof the pulpit, the wall which formed its back was adorned \nwith a large painting representing a gallant ship beating \nagainst a terrible storm off a lee coast of black rocks and \nsnowy breakers. But high above the flying scud and \ndark-rolling clouds, there floated a little isle of sunlight, \nfrom which beamed forth an angel's face ; and this bright \nface shed a distinct spot of radiance upon the ship's tossed \ndeck, something like that silver plate now inserted into the \nVictory's plank where Nelson fell. ' Ah, noble ship/ the \nangel seemed to say, 'beat on, beat on, thou noble ship, and \nbear a hardy helm ; for lo ! the sun is breaking through ; \nthe clouds are rolling off serenest azure is at hand.' \n\nNor was the pulpit itself without a trace of the same \nsea -taste that had achieved the ladder and the picture. \nIts panelled front was in the likeness of a ship's bluff bows, \nand the Holy Bible rested on a projecting piece of scroll \nwork, fashioned after a ship's fiddle -headed beak. \n\nWhat could be more full of meaning ? for the pulpit \nis ever this earth's foremost part ; all the rest comes in \nits rear ; the pulpit leads the world. From thence it is \nthe storm of God's quick wrath is first descried, and the \nbow must bear the earliest brunt. From thence it is the \nGod of breezes fair or foul is first invoked for favourable \nwinds. Yes, the world 's a ship on its passage out, and \nnot a voyage complete ; and the pulpit is its prow. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX \n\n\n\nTHE SERMON \n\nFATHER MAPPLE rose, and in a mild voice of unassuming \nauthority ordered the scattered people to condense. \n' Starboard gangway, there ! side away to larboard \nlarboard gangway to starboard ! Midships ! midships ! ' \n\nThere was a low rumbling of heavy sea-boots among the \nbenches, and a still slighter shuffling of women's shoes, \nand all was quiet again, and every eye on the preacher. \n\nHe paused a little ; then kneeling in the pulpit's bows, \nfolded his large brown hands across his chest, uplifted \nhis closed eyes, and offered a prayer so deeply devout \nthat he seemed kneeling and praying at the bottom of \nthe sea. \n\nThis ended, in prolonged solemn tones, like the continual \ntolling of a bell in a ship that is foundering at sea in a fog \nin such tones he commenced reading the following hymn ; \nbut changing his manner toward the concluding stanzas, \nburst forth with a pealing exultation and joy : \n\n* The ribs and terrors in the whale \n\nArched over me a dismal gloom, \nWhile all God's sun-lit waves rolled by, \nAnd lift me deepening down to doom. \n\n' I saw the opening maw of hell, \n\nWith endless pains and sorrows there ; \nWhich none but they that feel can tell \nOh, I was plunging to despair. \n\nVOL. I. D \n\n\n\n50 MOBY-DICK \n\n4 In black distress, I called my God, \n\nWhen I could scarce believe him mine, \nHe bowed his ear to my complaints \nNo more the whale did me confine. \n\n' With speed he flew to my relief, \n\nAs on a radiant dolphin borne ; \nAwful, yet bright, as lightning shone \nThe face of my Deliverer God. \n\n' My song for ever shall record \n\nThat terrible, that joyful hour ; \nI give the glory to my God, \n\nHis all the mercy and the power.' \n\nNearly all joined in singing this hymn, which swelled \nhigh above the howling of the storm. A brief pause \nensued ; the preacher slowly turned over the leaves of \nthe Bible, and at last, folding his hand down upon the \nproper page, said : ' Beloved shipmates, clinch the last \nverse of the first chapter of Jonah \" And God had pre- \npared a great fish to swallow up Jonah.\" \n\n' Shipmates, this book, containing only four chapters \nfour yarns is one of the smallest strands in the mighty \ncable of the Scriptures. Yet what depths of the soul does \nJonah's deep sea-line sound ! what a pregnant lesson to \nus is this prophet ! What a noble thing is that canticle \nin the fish's belly ! How billow-like and boisterously \ngrand ! We feel the floods surging over us ; we sound with \nhim to the kelpy bottom of the waters ; sea-weed and all \nthe slime of the sea is about us ! But what is this lesson \nthat the book of Jonah teaches ? Shipmates, it is a two- \nstranded lesson ; a lesson to us all as sinful men, and a \nlesson to me as a pilot of the living God. As sinful men, \nit is a lesson to us all, because it is a story of the sin, hard- \nheartedness, suddenly awakened fears, the swift punish- ! \n\n\n\nTHE SERMON 51 \n\nment, repentance, prayers, and finally the deliverance and \njoy of Jonah. As with all sinners among men, the sin \nof this son of Amittai was in his wilful disobedience of the \ncommand of God never mind now what that command \nwas, or how conveyed which he found a hard command. \nBut all the things that God would have us do are hard for \nus to do remember that and hence, He oftener com- \nmands us than endeavours to persuade. And if we obey \nGod, we must disobey ourselves ; and it is in this dis- \nobeying ourselves, wherein the hardness of obeying God \nconsists. \n\n' With this sin of disobedience in him, Jonah still \nfurther flouts at God, by seeking to flee from Him. He \nthinks that a ship made by men will carry him into \ncountries where God does not reign, but only the captains \nof this earth. He skulks about the wharves of Joppa, \nand seeks a ship that 's bound for Tarshish. There lurks, \nperhaps, a hitherto unheeded meaning here. By all \naccounts Tarshish could have been no other city than the \nmodern Cadiz. That 's the opinion of learned men. And \nwhere is Cadiz, shipmates ? Cadiz is in Spain ; as far by \nwater, from Joppa, as Jonah could possibly have sailed \nin those ancient days, when the Atlantic was an almost \nunknown sea. Because Joppa, the modern Jaffa, ship- \nmates, is on the most easterly coast of the Mediterranean, \nthe Syrian ; and Tarshish or Cadiz more than two thousand \nmiles to the westward from that, just outside the Straits \nof Gibraltar. See ye not then, shipmates, that Jonah \nsought to flee world- wide from God ? Miserable man ! \nOh ! most contemptible and worthy of all scorn ; with \nslouched hat and guilty eye, skulking from his God ; \nprowling among the shipping like a vile burglar hastening \nto cross the seas. So disordered, self -condemning is his \nlook, that had there been policemen in those days, Jonah, \non the mere suspicion of something wrong, had been \n\n\n\n52 MOBY-DICK \n\narrested ere he touched a deck. How plainly he 's a \nfugitive ! no baggage, not a hat-box, valise, or carpet- \nbag, no friends accompany him to the wharf with their \nadieux. At last, after much dodging search, he finds the \nTarshish ship receiving the last items of her cargo ; and \nas he steps on board to see its captain in the cabin, all \nthe sailors for the moment desist from hoisting in the \ngoods, to mark the stranger's evil eye. Jonah sees this ; \nbut in vain he tries to look ah 1 ease and confidence ; in \nvain essays his wretched smile. Strong intuitions of the \nman assure the mariners he can be no innocent. In their \ngamesome but still serious way, one whispers to the other \n\" Jack, he 's robbed a widow \" ; or, \" Joe, do you mark \nhim ; he 's a bigamist \" ; or, \" Harry, lad, I guess he 's the \nadulterer that broke jail in old Gomorrah, or belike, one \nof the missing murderers from Sodom.\" Another runs \nto read the bill that 's stuck against the spile upon the \nwharf to which the ship is moored, offering five hundred \ngold coins for the apprehension of a. parricide, and con- \ntaining a description of his person. He reads, and looks \nfrom Jonah to the bill ; while all his sympathetic ship- \nmates now crowd round Jonah, prepared to lay their \nhands upon him. Frighted Jonah trembles, and summon- \ning all his boldness to his face, only looks so much the \nmore a coward. He will not confess himself suspected ; \nbut that itself is strong suspicion. So he makes the best \nof it ; and when the sailors find him not to be the man that \nis advertised, they let him pass, and he descends into the \ncabin. \n\n' \" Who 's there ? \" cries the captain at his busy desk, \nhurriedly making out his papers for the Customs \"Who 's \nthere ? \" Oh ! how that harmless question mangles \nJonah ! For the instant he almost turns to flee again. \nBut he rallies. \" I seek a passage in this ship to Tarshish ; \nhow soon sail ye, sir ? \" Thus far the busy captain had \n\n\n\nTHE SERMON 53 \n\nnot looked up to Jonah, though the man now stands \nbefore him ; but no sooner does he hear that hollow voice, \nthan he darts a scrutinising glance. \" We sail with the \nnext coming tide,\" at last he slowly answered, still \nintently eyeing him. \" No sooner, sir ? \" \" Soon enough \nfor any honest man that goes a passenger.\" Ha ! Jonah, \nthat 's another stab. But he swiftly calls away the \ncaptain from that scent. \" I '11 sail with ye,\" he says, \n\" the passage money, how much is that ? I '11 pay \nnow.\" For it is particularly written, shipmates, as if it \nwere a thing not to be overlooked in this history, \" that \nhe paid the fare thereof \" ere the craft did sail. And \ntaken with the context, this is full of meaning. \n\n' Now Jonah's captain, shipmates, was one whose dis- \ncernment detects crime in any, but whose cupidity exposes \nit only in the penniless. In this world, shipmates, sin \nthat pays its way can travel freely, and without a pass- \nport ; whereas Virtue, if a pauper, is stopped at all \nfrontiers. So Jonah's captain prepares to test the length \nof Jonah's purse, ere he judge him openly. He charges \nhim thrice the usual sum ; and it 's assented to. Then \nthe captain knows that Jonah is a fugitive ; but at the \nsame time resolves to help a flight that paves its rear with \ngold. Yet when Jonah fairly takes out his purse, prudent \nsuspicions still molest the captain. He rings every coin \nto find a counterfeit. Not a forger, anyway, he mutters ; \nand Jonah is put down for his passage. \" Point out my \nstate-room, sir,\" says Jonah now, \" I 'm travel- weary ; \nI need sleep.\" \"Thou look'st like it,\" says the captain, \n\" there 's thy room.\" Jonah enters, and would lock the \ndoor, but the lock contains no key. Hearing him foolishly \nfumbling there, the captain laughs lowly to himself, and \nmutters something about the doors of convicts' cells being \nnever allowed to be locked within. All dressed and dusty \nas he is, Jonah throws himself into his berth, and finds \n\n\n\n54 MOBY-DICK \n\nthe little state-room ceiling almost resting on his forehead. \nThe air is close, and Jonah gasps. Then, in that con- \ntracted hole, sunk, too, beneath the ship's water-line, \nJonah feels the heralding presentiment of that stifling \nhour, when the whale shall hold him in the smallest of \nhis bowel's wards. \n\n' Screwed at its axis against the side, a swinging lamp \nslightly oscillates in Jonah's room ; and the ship, heeling \nover toward the wharf with the weight of the last bales \nreceived, the lamp, flame and all, though in slight motion, \nstill maintains a permanent obliquity with reference to \nthe room ; though, in truth, infallibly straight itself, it \nbut made obvious the false, lying levels among which it \nhung. The lamp alarms and frightens Jonah ; as lying \nin his berth his tormented eyes roll round the place, and \nthis thus far successful fugitive finds no refuge for his \nrestless glance. But that contradiction in the lamp more \nand more appals him. The floor, the ceiling, and the \nside, are all awry. \" Oh ! so my conscience hangs in \nme ! \" he groans, \" straight upward, so it burns ; but the \nchambers of my soul are all in crookedness ! \" \n\n' Like one who after a night of drunken revelry hies \nto his bed, still reeling, but with conscience yet pricking \nhim, as the plungings of the Roman race -horse but so \nmuch the more strike his steel tags into him ; as one who \nin that miserable plight still turns and turns in giddy \nanguish, praying God for annihilation until the fit be \npassed ; and at last amid the whirl of woe he feels, a deep \nstupor steals over him, as over the man who bleeds to \ndeath, for conscience is the wound, and there 's naught \nto staunch it ; so, after sore wrestlings in his berth, \nJonah's prodigy of ponderous misery drags him drowning \ndown to sleep. \n\nc And now the time of tide has come ; the ship casts \noff her cables ; and from the deserted wharf the un- \n\n\n\nTHE SERMON 55 \n\ncheered ship for Tarshish, all careening, glides to sea. \nThat ship, my friends, was the first of recorded smugglers ! \nthe contraband was Jonah. But the sea rebels ; he will \nnot bear the wicked burden. A dreadful storm comes on, \nthe ship is like to break. But now when the boatswain \ncalls all hands to lighten her ; when boxes, bales, and \njars are clattering overboard ; when the wind is shrieking, \nand the men are yelling, and every plank thunders with \ntrampling feet right over Jonah's head ; in all this raging \ntumult, Jonah sleeps his hideous sleep. He sees no black \nsky and raging sea, feels not the reeling timbers, and little \nhears he or heeds he the far rush of the mighty whale, \nwhich even now with open mouth is cleaving the seas \nafter him. Ay, shipmates, Jonah was gone down into \nthe sides of the ship a berth in the cabin as I have taken \nit and was fast asleep. But the frightened master comes \nto him, and shrieks hi his dead ear, \" What meanest thou, \nsleeper ! arise ! \" Startled from his lethargy by that \ndireful cry, Jonah staggers to his feet, and stumbling to \nthe deck, grasps a shroud, to look out upon the sea. But \nat that moment he is sprung upon by a panther billow \nleaping over the bulwarks. Wave after wave thus leaps \ninto the ship, and finding no speedy vent runs roaring \nfore and aft, till the mariners come nigh to drowning \nwhile yet afloat. And ever, as the white moon shows her \naffrighted face from the steep gullies in the blackness \noverhead, aghast Jonah sees the rearing bowsprit pointing \nhigh upward, but soon beat downward again toward the \ntormented deep. \n\n' Terrors upon terrors run shouting through his soul. \nIn all his cringing attitudes, the God-fugitive is now too \nplainly known. The sailors mark him ; more and more \ncertain grow their suspicions of him, and at last, fully \nto test the truth, by referring the whole matter to high \nHeaven, they fall to casting lots, to see for whose cause \n\n\n\n56 MOBY-DICK \n\nthis great tempest was upon them. The lot is Jonah's ; \nthat discovered, then how furiously they mob him with \ntheir questions. \" What is thine occupation ? Whence \ncomest thou ? Thy country ? What people ? \" But \nmark now, my shipmates, the behaviour of poor Jonah. \nThe eager mariners but ask him who he is, and where \nfrom ; whereas, they not only receive an answer to those \nquestions, but likewise another answer to a question not \nput by them, but the unsolicited answer is forced from \nJonah by the hard hand of God that is upon him. \n\n' \" I am a Hebrew,\" he cries and then \" I fear the \nLord the God of Heaven who hath made the sea and the \ndry land ! \" Fear him, O Jonah ? Ay, well mightest \nthou fear the Lord God then ! Straightway, he now goes \non to make a full confession ; whereupon the mariners \nbecame more and more appalled, but still are pitiful. \nFor when Jonah, not yet supplicating God for mercy, \nsince he but too well knew the darkness of his deserts, \nwhen wretched Jonah cries out to them to take him and \ncast him forth into the sea, for he knew that for his sake \nthis great tempest was upon them ; they mercifully turn \nfrom him, and seek by other means to save the ship. \nBut all in vain ; the indignant gale howls louder ; then, \nwith one hand raised invokingly to God, with the other \nthey not unreluctantly lay hold of Jonah. \n\n' And now behold Jonah taken up as an anchor and \ndropped into the sea ; when instantly an oily calmness \nfloats out from the east, and the sea is still, as Jonah \ncarries down the gale with him, leaving smooth water \nbehind. He goes down in the whirling heart of such a \nmasterless commotion that he scarce heeds the moment \nwhen he drops seething into the yawning jaws awaiting \nhim ; and the whale shoots-to all his ivory teeth, like so \nmany white bolts, upon his prison. Then Jonah prayed \nunto the Lord out of the fish's belly. But observe his \n\n\n\nTHE SERMON 57 \n\nprayer, and learn a weighty lesson. For sinful as he is, \nJonah does not weep and wail for direct deliverance. \nHe feels that his dreadful punishment is just. He leaves \nall his deliverance to God, contenting himself with this, \nthat spite of all his pains and pangs, he will still look \ntoward His holy temple. And here, shipmates, is true \nand faithful repentance ; not clamorous for pardon, but \ngrateful for punishment. And how pleasing to God was \nthis conduct in Jonah, is shown in the eventual deliver- \nance of him from the sea and the whale. Shipmates, I \ndo not place Jonah before you to be copied for his sin, \nbut I do place him before you as a model for repentance. \nSin not ; but if you do, take heed to repent of it like Jonah. ' \n\nWhile he was speaking these words, the howling of the \nshrieking, slanting storm without seemed to add new \npower to the preacher, who, when describing Jonah's sea- \nstorm, seemed tossed by a storm himself. His deep chest \nheaved as with a ground-swell ; his tossed arms seemed \nthe warring elements at work ; and the thunders that \nrolled away from off his swarthy brow, and the light \nleaping from his eye, made all his simple hearers look on \nhim with a quick fear that was strange to them. \n\nThere now came a lull in his look, as he silently turned \nover the leaves of the Book once more ; and, at last, \nstanding motionless, with closed eyes, for the moment, \nseemed communing with God and himself. \n\nBut again he leaned over toward the people, and \nbowing his head lowly, with an aspect of the deepest \nyet manliest humility, he spake these words : \n\nc Shipmates, God has laid but one hand upon you ; \nboth his hands press upon me. I have read ye by what \nmurky light may be mine the lesson that Jonah teaches \nto all sinners ; and therefore to ye, and still more to me, \nfor I am a greater sinner than ye. And now how gladly \nwould I come down from this mast-head and sit on the \n\n\n\n58 MOBY-DICK \n\nhatches there where you sit, and listen as you listen, \nwhile some one of you reads me that other and more \nawful lesson which Jonah teaches to me, as a pilot of the \nliving God. How being an anointed pilot -prophet, or \nspeaker of true things, and bidden by the Lord to sound \nthose unwelcome truths in the ears of a wicked Nineveh, \nJonah, appalled at the hostility he should raise, fled from \nhis mission, and sought to escape his duty and his God by \ntaking ship at Joppa. But God is everywhere ; Tarshish \nhe never reached. As we have seen, God came upon him \nin the whale, and swallowed him down to living gulfs \nof doom, and with swift slantings tore him along \" into \nthe midst of the seas,\" where the eddying depths sucked \nhim ten thousand fathoms down, and \" the weeds were \nwrapped about his head,\" and all the watery world of woe \nbowled over him. Yet even then beyond the reach of any \nplummet \" out of the belly of hell \" when the whale \ngrounded upon the ocean's utmost bones, even then, God \nheard the engulphed, repenting prophet when he cried. \nThen God spake unto the fish ; and from the shuddering \ncold and blackness of the sea, the whale came breaching \nup toward the warm and pleasant sun, and all the delights \nof air and earth ; and \" vomited out Jonah upon the dry \nland \" ; when the word of the Lord came a second time ; \nand Jonah, bruised and beaten his ears, like two sea- \nshells, still multitudinously murmuring of the ocean \nJonah did the Almighty's bidding. And what was that, \nshipmates ? To preach the Truth to the face of False- \nhood ! That was it ! \n\n' This, shipmates, this is that other lesson ; and we \nto that pilot of the living God who slights it. Woe to \nhim whom this world charms from Gospel duty ! Woe \nto him who seeks to pour oil upon the waters when God \nhas brewed them into a gale ! Woe to him who seeks \nto please rather than to appal ! Woe to him whose good \n\n\n\nTHE SERMON 59 \n\nname is more to him than goodness ! Woe to him who, \nin this world, courts not dishonour ! Woe to him who \nwould not be true, even though to be false were salva- \ntion ! Yea, woe to him who, as the great Pilot Paul has \nit, while preaching to others is himself a castaway ! ' \n\nHe drooped and fell away from himself for a moment ; \nthen lifting his face to them again, showed a deep joy \nin his eyes, as he cried out with a heavenly enthusiasm, \n' But oh ! shipmates ! on the starboard hand of every \nwoe, there is a sure delight ; and higher the top of that \ndelight, than the bottom of the woe is deep. Is not the \nmain-truck higher than the kelson is low ? Delight is to \nhim a far, far upward, and inward delight who against \nthe proud gods and commodores of this earth, ever stands \nforth his own inexorable self. Delight is to him whose \nstrong arms yet support him, when the ship of this base \ntreacherous world has gone down beneath him. Delight \nis to him, who gives no quarter in the truth, and kills, \nburns, and destroys all sin though he pluck it out from \nunder the robes of Senators and Judges. Delight, top- \ngallant delight is to him, who acknowledges no law or \nlord, but the Lord his God, and is only a patriot to heaven. \nDelight is to him, whom all the waves of the billows of \nthe seas of the boisterous mob can never shake from this \nsure Keel of the Ages. And eternal delight and delicious- \nness will be his, who coming to lay him down, can say with \nhis final breath Father ! chiefly known to me by \nThy rod mortal or immortal, here I die. I have striven \nto be Thine, more than to be this world's, or mine own. \nYet this is nothing ; I leave eternity to Thee ; for what \nis man that he should live out the lifetime of his God 1 ' \n\nHe said no more, but slowly waving a benediction, \ncovered his face with his hands, and so remained kneeling, \ntill all the people had departed, and he was left alone in \nthe place. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER X \n\nA BOSOM FRIEND \n\nRETURNING to the Spouter-Inn from the Chapel, I found \nQueequeg there quite alone ; he having left the Chapel \nbefore the benediction some time. He was sitting on a \nbench before the fire, with his feet on the stove hearth, \nand in one hand was holding close up to his face that \nlittle negro idol of his ; peering hard into its face, and \nwith a jack-knife gently whittling away at its nose, \nmeanwhile humming to himself in his heathenish way. \n\nBut being now interrupted, he put up the image ; and \npretty soon, going to the table, took up a large book there, \nand placing it on his lap began counting the pages with \ndeliberate regularity ; at every fiftieth page as I fancied \nstopping a moment, looking vacantly around him, \nand giving utterance to a long-drawn gurgling whistle \nof astonishment. He would then begin again at the next \nfifty ; seeming to commence at number one each time, \nas though he could not count more than fifty, and it \nwas only by such a large number of fifties being found \ntogether, that his astonishment at the multitude of pages \nwas excited. \n\nWith much interest I sat watching him. Savage \nthough he was, and hideously marred about the face \nat least to my taste his countenance yet had a something \nin it which was by no means disagreeable. You cannot \nhide the soul. Through all his unearthly tattooings, I \nthought I saw the traces of a simple honest heart ; and \nin his large, deep eyes, fiery black and bold, there seemed \n\n60 \n\n\n\nA BOSOM FRIEND 61 \n\ntokens of a spirit that would dare a thousand devils. \nAnd besides all this, there was a certain lofty bearing \nabout the pagan, which even his uncouthness could not \naltogether maim. He looked like a man who had never \ncringed and never had had a creditor. Whether it was, \ntoo, that his head being shaved, his forehead was drawn \nout in freer and brighter relief, and looked more expansive \nthan it otherwise would, this I will not venture to decide ; \nbut certain it was his head was phrenologically an ex- \ncellent one. It may seem ridiculous, but it reminded me \nof General Washington's head, as seen in the popular \nbusts of him. It had the same long regularly graded \nretreating slope from above the brows, which were like- \nwise very projecting, like two long promontories thickly \nwooded on top. Queequeg was George Washington \ncannibalistically developed. \n\nWhilst I was thus closely scanning him, half pretending \nmeanwhile to be looking out at the storm from the case- \nment, he never heeded my presence, never troubled him- \nself with so much as a single glance ; but appeared wholly \noccupied with counting the pages of the marvellous book. \nConsidering how sociably we had been sleeping together \nthe night previous, and especially considering the affection- \nate arm I had found thrown over me upon waking in the \nmorning, I thought this indifference of his very strange. \nBut savages are strange beings ; at times you do not \nknow exactly how to take them. At first they are over- \nawing ; their calm self-collectedness of simplicity seems \na Socratic wisdom. I had noticed also that Queequeg \nnever consorted at all, or but very little, with the other \nseamen in the inn. He made no advances whatever ; \nappeared to have no desire to enlarge the circle of his \nacquaintances. All this struck me as mighty singular ; \nyet, upon second thoughts, there was something almost \nsublime in it. Here was a man some twenty thousand \n\n\n\nI \n\n\n\n62 MOBY-DICK \n\nmiles from home, by the way of Cape Horn, that is \nwhich was the only way he could get there thrown \namong people as strange to him as though he were in the \nplanet Jupiter ; and yet he seemed entirely at his ease ; \npreserving the utmost serenity ; content with his own \ncompanionship ; always equal to himself. Surely this \nwas a touch of fine philosophy ; though no doubt he had \nnever heard there was such a thing as that. But, per- \nhaps, to be true philosophers, we mortals should not \nbe conscious of so living or so striving. So soon as I \nhear that such or such a man gives himself out for a \nphilosopher, I conclude that, like the dyspeptic old woman, \nhe must have ' broken his digester.' \n\nAs I sat there in that now lonely room ; the fire burn- \ning low, in that mild stage when, after its first intensity \nhas warmed the air, it then only glows to be looked at ; \nthe evening shades and phantoms gathering round the \ncasements, and peering in upon us silent, solitary twain ; \nthe storm booming without in solemn swells ; I began to \nbe sensible of strange feelings. I felt a melting in me. \nNo more my splintered heart and maddened hand were \nturned against the wolfish world. This soothing savage \nhad redeemed it. There he sat, his very indifference \nspeaking a nature in which there lurked no civilised \nhypocrisies and bland deceits. Wild he was ; a very \nsight of sights to see ; yet I began to feel myself mysteri- \nously drawn toward him. And those same things that \nwould have repelled most others, they were the very \nmagnets that thus drew me. 1 11 try a pagan friend, \nthought I, since Christian kindness has proved but hollow \ncourtesy. I drew my bench near him, and made some \nfriendly signs and hints, doing my best to talk with him \nmeanwhile. At first he little noticed these advances ; \nbut presently, upon my referring to his last night's \nhospitalities, he made out to ask me whether we were \n\n\n\nA BOSOM FRIEND \n\n\n\n63 \n\n\n\nagain to be bedfellows. I told him yes ; whereat I \nthought he looked pleased, perhaps a little complimented. \n\nWe then turned over the book together, and I en- \ndeavoured to explain to him the purpose of the printing, \nand the meaning of the few pictures that were in it. Thus \nI soon engaged his interest ; and from that we went to \njabbering the best we could about the various outer sights \nto be seen in this famous town. Soon I proposed a social \nsmoke ; and, producing his pouch and tomahawk, he \nquietly offered me a puff. And then we sat exchanging \npuffs from that wild pipe of his, and keeping it regularly \npassing between us. \n\nIf there yet lurked any ice of indifference toward me \nin the pagan's breast, this pleasant, genial smoke we had \nsoon thawed it out, and left us cronies. He seemed to \ntake to me quite as naturally and unbiddenly as I to him ; \nand when our smoke was over, he pressed his forehead \nagainst mine, clasped me round the waist, and said that \nhenceforth we were married ; meaning, in his country's \nphrase, that we were bosom friends ; he would gladly \ndie for me, if need should be. In a countryman this \nsudden flame of friendship would have seemed far too \npremature, a thing to be much distrusted ; but in this \nsimple savage those old rules would not apply. \n\nAfter supper, and another social chat and smoke, we \nwent to our room together. He made me a present of \nhis embalmed head ; took out his enormous tobacco \nwallet, and groping under the tobacco, drew out some \nthirty dollars in silver ; then spreading them on the \ntable, and mechanically dividing them into two equal \nportions, pushed one of them toward me, and said it was \nmine. I was going to remonstrate ; but he silenced me \nby pouring them into my trowsers' pockets. I let them \nstay. He then went about his evening prayers, took \nout his idol, and removed the paper fire-board. By \n\n\n\n64 MOBY-DICK \n\ncertain signs and symptoms, I thought he seemed anxious \nfor me to join him ; but well knowing what was to follow, \nI deliberated a moment whether, in case he invited me, \nI would comply or otherwise. \n\nI was a good Christian ; born and bred in the bosom \nof the infallible Presbyterian Church. How then could \nI unite with this wild idolater in worshipping his piece of \nwood ? But what is worship ? thought I. Do you \nsuppose now, Ishmael, that the magnanimous God of \nheaven and earth pagans and all included can possibly \nbe jealous of an insignificant bit of black wood ? Im- \npossible ! But what is worship ? to do the will of \nGod ? that is worship. And what is the will of God ? \nto do to my fellow-man what I would have my fellow-man \nto do to me that is the will of God. Now, Queequeg is \nmy fellow- man. And what do I wish that this Queequeg \nwould do to me ? Why, unite with me in my particular \nPresbyterian form of worship. Consequently, I must \nthen unite with him in his ; ergo, I must turn idolater. \nSo I kindled the shavings ; helped prop up the innocent \nlittle idol ; offered him burnt biscuit with Queequeg ; \nsalaamed before him twice or thrice ; kissed his nose ; \nand that done, we undressed and went to bed, at peace \nwith our own consciences and all the world. But we \ndid not go to sleep without some little chat. \n\nHow it is I know not ; but there is no place like a bed \nfor confidential disclosures between friends. Man and \nwife, they say, there open the very bottom of their souls \nto each other ; and some old couples often lie and chat \nover old times till nearly morning. Thus, then, in our \nhearts' honeymoon, lay I and Queequeg a cosy, loving \npair. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI \n\nNIGHTGOWN \n\nWE had lain thus in bed, chatting and napping at short \nintervals, and Queequeg now and then affectionately \nthrowing his brown tattooed legs over mine, and then \ndrawing them back ; so entirely sociable and free and easy \nwere we ; when, at last, by reason of our confabulations, \nwhat little nappishness remained in us altogether departed, \nand we felt like getting up again, though day-break was \nyet some way down the future. \n\nYes, we became very wakeful ; so much so that our \nrecumbent position began to grow wearisome, and by \nlittle and little we found ourselves sitting up ; the clothes \nwell tucked around us, leaning against the head-board \nwith our four knees drawn up close together, and our two \nnoses bending over them, as if our knee-pans were warm- \ning-pans. We felt very nice and snug, the more so since \nit was so chilly out of doors ; indeed out of bed-clothes \ntoo, seeing that there was no fire in the room. The more \nso, I say, because truly to enjoy bodily warmth, some \nsmall part of you must be cold, for there is no quality \nin this world that is not what it is merely by contrast. \nNothing exists in itself. If you flatter yourself that you \nare all over comfortable, and have been so a long time, \nthen you cannot be said to be comfortable any more. \nBut if, like Queequeg and me in the bed, the tip of your \nnose or the crown of your head be slightly chilled, why \nthen, indeed, in the general consciousness you feel most \ndelightfully and unmistakably warm. For this reason \n\nVOL. i. E \n\n\n\n66 MOBY-DICK \n\na sleeping apartment should never be furnished with a \nfire, which is one of the luxurious discomforts of the rich. \nFor the height of this sort of deliciousness is to have \nnothing but the blanket between you and your snugness \nand the cold of the outer air. Then there you lie \nlike the one warm spark in the heart of an arctic \ncrystal. \n\nWe had been sitting in this crouching manner for some \ntime, when all at once I thought I would open my eyes ; \nfor when between sheets, whether by day or by night, \nand whether asleep or awake, I have a way of always \nkeeping my eyes shut, in order the more to concentrate \nthe snugness of being in bed. Because no man can ever \nfeel his own identity aright except his eyes be closed ; as \nif darkness were indeed the proper element of our essences, \nthough light be more congenial to our clayey part. Upon \nopening my eyes then, and coming out of my own pleasant \nand self-created darkness into the imposed and coarse \nouter gloom of the unilluminated twelve-o'clock-at-night, \nI experienced a disagreeable revulsion. Nor did I at all \nobject to the hint from Queequeg that perhaps it were best \nto strike a light, seeing that we were so wide awake ; and \nbesides he felt a strong desire to have a few quiet puffs \nfrom his tomahawk. Be it said, that though I had felt \nsuch a strong repugnance to his smoking in the bed the \nnight before, yet see how elastic our stiff prejudices grow \nwhen love once comes to bend them. For now I liked \nnothing better than to have Queequeg smoking by me, \neven in bed, because he seemed to be full of such serene \nhousehold joy then. I no more felt unduly concerned \nfor the landlord's policy of insurance. I was only alive \nto the condensed confidential comfortableness of sharing \na pipe and a blanket with a real friend. With our shaggy \njackets drawn about our shoulders, we now passed the \ntomahawk from one to the other, till slowly there grew \n\n\n\nNIGHTGOWN 67 \n\nover us a blue hanging tester of smoke, illuminated by \nthe flame of the new-lit lamp. \n\nWhether it was that this undulating tester rolled the \nsavage away to far distant scenes, I know not, but he now \nspoke of his native island ; and, eager to hear his history, \nI begged him to go on and tell it. He gladly complied. \nThough at the time I but ill comprehended not a few of \nhis words, yet subsequent disclosures, when I had become \nmore familiar with his broken phraseology, now enable \nme to present the whole story such as it may prove in \nthe mere skeleton I give. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII \n\nBIOGRAPHICAL \n\nQUEEQUEG was a native of Rokovoko, an island far away \nto the west and south. It is not down in any map ; true \nplaces never are. \n\nWhen a new-hatched savage running wild about his \nnative woodlands in a grass clout, followed by the nib- \nbling goats, as if he were a green sapling ; even then, in \nQueequeg's ambitious soul, lurked a strong desire to see \nsomething more of Christendom than a specimen whaler \nor two. His father was a High Chief, a King ; his uncle \na High Priest ; and on the maternal side he boasted aunts \nwho were the wives of unconquerable warriors. There \nwas excellent blood in his veins royal stuff ; though \nsadly vitiated, I fear, by the cannibal propensity he \nnourished in his untutored youth. \n\nA Sag Harbour ship visited his father's bay, and Quee- \nqueg sought a passage to Christian lands. But the ship, \nhaving her full complement of seamen, spurned his suit ; \nand not all the King his father's influence could prevail. \nBut Queequeg vowed a vow. Alone in his canoe, he \npaddled off to a distant strait, which he knew the ship \nmust pass through when she quitted the island. On one \nside was a coral reef ; on the other a low tongue of land, \ncovered with mangrove thickets that grew out into the \nwater. Hiding his canoe, still afloat, among these thickets, \nwith its prow seaward, he sat down in the stern, paddle \nlow in hand ; and when the ship was gliding by, like a \nflash he darted out ; gained her side ; with one backward \n\n68 \n\n\n\nBIOGRAPHICAL 69 \n\ndash of his foot capsized and sank his canoe ; climbed \nup the chains ; and throwing himself at full length upon \nthe deck, grappled a ring-bolt there, and swore not to let \nit go, though hacked in pieces. \n\nIn vain the captain threatened to throw him overboard ; \nsuspended a cutlass over his naked wrists ; Queequeg was \nthe son of a King, and Queequeg budged not. Struck \nby his desperate dauntlessness, and his wild desire to visit \nChristendom, the captain at last relented, and told him \nhe might make himself at home. But this fine young \nsavage this sea Prince of Wales never saw the captain's \ncabin. They put him down among the sailors, and made \na whaleman of him. But like Czar Peter content to toil \nin the shipyards of foreign cities, Queequeg disdained no \nseeming ignominy, if thereby he might happily gain the \npower of enlightening his untutored countrymen. For at \nbottom so he told me he was actuated by a profound \ndesire to learn among the Christians, the arts whereby \nto make his people still happier than they were ; and more \nthan that, still better than they were. But, alas ! the \n\\ practices of whalemen soon convinced him that even \nj Christians could be both miserable and wicked ; infinitely \nmore so, than all his father's heathens. Arrived at last \nin old Sag Harbour ; and seeing what the sailors did \nthere ; and then going on to Nantucket, and seeing how \nthey spent their wages in that place also, poor Queequeg \ngave it up for lost. Thought he, it 5 s a wicked world \nin all meridians ; 1 11 die a pagan. \n\nAnd thus an old idolater at heart, he yet lived among \nthese Christians, wore their clothes, and tried to talk their \ngibberish. Hence the queer ways about him, though \nnow some time from home. \n\nBy hints, I asked him whether he did not propose going \nback, and having a coronation ; since he might now \nconsider his father dead and gone, he being very old and \n\n\n\n70 MOBY-DICK \n\nfeeble at the last accounts. He answered no, not yet ; \nand added that he was fearful Christianity, or rather \nChristians, had unfitted him for ascending the pure and \nundefiled throne of thirty pagan kings before him. But \nby and by, he said, he would return, as soon as he felt \nhimself baptized again. For the nonce, however, he \nproposed to sail about, and sow his wild oats in all four \noceans. They had made a harpooneer of him, and that \nbarbed iron was in lieu of a sceptre now. \n\nI asked him what might be his immediate purpose, \ntouching his future movements. He answered, to go to \nsea again, in his old vocation. Upon this, I told him that \nwhaling was my own design, and informed him of my \nintention to sail out of Nantucket, as being the most \npromising port for an adventurous whaleman to embark \nfrom. He at once resolved to accompany me to that \nisland, ship aboard the same vessel, get into the same \nwatch, the same boat, the same mess with me, in short \nto share my every hap ; with both my hands in his, boldly \ndip into the Potluck of both worlds. To all this I joy- \nously assented ; for besides the affection I now felt for \nQueequeg, he was an experienced harpooneer, and as such, \ncould not fail to be of great usefulness to one who, like me, \nwas wholly ignorant of the mysteries of whaling, though \nwell acquainted with the sea as known to merchant \nseamen. \n\nHis story being ended with his pipe's last dying puff, \nQueequeg embraced me, pressed his forehead against \nmine, and blowing out the light, we rolled over from each \nother, this way and that, and very soon were sleeping. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII \n\nWHEELBARROW \n\nNEXT morning, Monday, after disposing of the embalmed \nhead to a barber, for a block, I settled my own and com- \nrade's bill ; using, however, my comrade's money. The \ngrinning landlord, as well as the boarders, seemed amaz- \ningly tickled at the sudden friendship which had sprung \nup between me and Queequeg especially as Peter Coffin's \ncock-and-bull stories about him had previously so much \nalarmed me concerning the very person whom I now \ncompanied with. \n\nWe borrowed a wheelbarrow, and embarking our \nthings, including my own poor carpet-bag, and Quee- \nqueg 's canvas sack and hammock, away we went down to \nthe Moss, the little Nantucket packet schooner moored \nat the wharf. As we were going along the people stared ; \nnot at Queequeg so much for they were used to seeing \ncannibals like him in their streets, but at seeing him \nand me upon such confidential terms. But we heeded \nthem not, going along wheeling the barrow by turns, \nand Queequeg now and then stopping to adjust the sheath \non his harpoon barbs. I asked him why he carried such \na troublesome thing with him ashore, and whether all \nwhaling-ships did not find their own harpoons. To this, \nin substance, he replied, that though what I hinted was \ntrue enough, yet he had a particular affection for his own \nharpoon, because it was of assured stuff, well tried in \nmany a mortal combat, and deeply intimate with the \nhearts of whales. In short, like many inland reapers and \n\n71 \n\n\n\n72 MOBY-DICK \n\nmowers, who go into the farmer's meadows armed with \ntheir own scythes though in no wise obliged to furnish \nthem even so, Queequeg, for his own private reasons, \npreferred his own harpoon. \n\nShifting the barrow from my hand to his, he told me \na funny story about the first wheelbarrow he had ever \nseen. It was in Sag Harbour. The owners of his ship, \nit seems, had lent him one, in which to carry his heavy \nchest to his boarding-house. Not to seem ignorant about \nthe thing though in truth he was entirely so, concerning \nthe precise way in which to manage the barrow Quee- \nqueg puts his chest upon it ; lashes it fast ; and then \nshoulders the barrow and marches up the wharf. ' Why/ \nsaid I, ' Queequeg, you might have known better than \nthat, one would think. Didn't the people laugh ? ' \n\nUpon this, he told me another story. The people \nof his island of Rokovoko, it seems, at their wedding \nfeasts express the fragrant water of young cocoa-nuts into \na large stained calabash like a punch -bowl ; and this \npunch -bowl always forms the great central ornament on \nthe braided mat where the feast is held. Now a certain \ngrand merchant ship once touched at Rokovoko, and its \ncommander from all accounts a very stately punctilious \ngentleman, at least for a sea-captain this commander \nwas invited to the wedding feast of Queequeg 's sister, a \npretty young princess just turned of ten. Well ; when all \nthe wedding guests were assembled at the bride's bamboo \ncottage, this captain marches in, and being assigned the \npost of honour, placed himself over against the punch- \nbowl, and between the High Priest and his majesty the \nKing, Queequeg 's father. Grace being said, for those \npeople have their grace as well as we though Queequeg \ntold me that unlike us, who at such times look downward \nto our platters, they, on the contrary, copying the ducks, \nglance upward to the great Giver of all feasts Grace, \n\n\n\nWHEELBARROW 73 \n\nI say, being said, the High Priest opens the banquet by \nthe immemorial ceremony of the island ; that is, dipping \nhis consecrated and consecrating fingers into the bowl \nbefore the blessed - beverage circulates. Seeing himself \nplaced next the Priest, and noting the ceremony, and \nthinking himself being captain of a ship as having \nplain precedence over a mere island King, especially in \nthe King's own house the captain coolly proceeds to \nwash his hands in the punch-bowl ; taking it, I suppose, \nfor a huge finger-glass. ' Now/ said Queequeg, ' what \nyou tink now ? Didn't our people laugh ? ' \n\nAt last, passage paid, and luggage safe, we stood on \nboard the schooner. Hoisting sail, it glided down the \nAcushnet river. On one side, New Bedford rose in \nterraces of streets, their ice -covered trees all glittering \nin the clear, cold air. Huge hills and mountains of casks \non casks were piled upon her wharves, and side by side \nthe world-wandering whale-ships lay silent and safely \nmoored at last ; while from others came a sound of \ncarpenters and coopers, with blended noises of fires and \nforges to melt the pitch, all betokening that new cruises \nwere on the start ; that one most perilous and long \nvoyage ended, only begins a second ; and a second ended, \nonly begins a third, and so on, forever and for aye. \nSuch is the endlessness, yea, the intolerableness of all \nearthly effort. \n\nGaining the more open water, the bracing breeze \nwaxed fresh ; the little Moss tossed the quick foam from \nher bows, as a young colt his snortings. How I snuffed \nthat Tartar air ! how I spurned that turnpike earth ! \nthat common highway all over dented with the marks \nof slavish heels and hoofs ; and turned me to admire the \nmagnanimity of the sea which will permit no records. \n\nAt the same foam-fountain, Queequeg seemed to drink \nand reel with me. His dusky nostrils swelled apart ; he \n\n\n\n74 MOBY-DICK \n\nshowed his filed and pointed teeth. On, on we flew ; and \nour offing gained, the Moss did homage to the blast ; \nducked and dived her brows as a slave before the Sultan. \nSideways leaning, we sideways darted ; every rope-yarn \ntingling like a wire ; the two tall masts buckling like \nIndian canes in land tornadoes. So full of this reeling \nscene were we, as we stood by the plunging bowsprit, \nthat for some time we did not notice the jeering glances \nof the passengers, a lubber-like assembly, who marvelled \nthat two fellow-beings should be so companionable ; as \nthough a white man were anything more dignified than \na whitewashed negro. But there were some boobies \nand bumpkins there, who, by their intense greenness, \nmust have come from the heart and centre of all verdure. \nQueequeg caught one of these young saplings mimicking \nhim behind his back. I thought the bumpkin's hour of \ndoom was come. Dropping his harpoon, the brawny \nsavage caught him in his arms, and by an almost miracu- \nlous dexterity and strength, sent him high up bodily into \nthe air ; then slightly tapping his stern in mid-somerset, \nthe fellow landed with bursting lungs upon his feet, while \nQueequeg, turning his back upon him, lighted his toma- \nhawk-pipe and passed it to me for a puff. \n\n' Capting ! capting ! ' yelled the bumpkin, running \ntoward that officer ; ' Capting, capting, here 's the \ndevil.' \n\n' Halloa, you sir/ cried the captain, a gaunt rib of the \nsea, stalking up to Queequeg, ' what in thunder do you \nmean by that ? Don't you know you might have killed \nthat chap ? ' \n\n' What him say ? ' said Queequeg, as he mildly turned \nto me. \n\n' He say,' said I, ' that you came near kill-e that man \nthere,' pointing to the still shivering greenhorn. \n\n' Kill-e/ cried Queequeg, twisting his tattooed face \n\n\n\nWHEELBARROW 75 \n\ninto an unearthly expression of disdain, ' ah ! him bevy \nsmall-e fish-e ; Queequeg no-kill-e so small-e fish-e ; \nQueequeg Idll-e big whale ! ' \n\n' Look you/ roared the captain, ' I '11 kill-e you, you \ncannibal, if you try any more of your tricks aboard here ; \nso mind your eye.' \n\nBut it so happened just then, that it was high time for \nthe captain to mind his own eye. The prodigious strain \nupon the mainsail had parted the weather-sheet, and the \ntremendous boom was now flying from side to side, com- \npletely sweeping the entire after part of the deck. The \npoor fellow whom Queequeg had handled so roughly, \nwas swept overboard ; all hands were in a panic ; and to \nattempt snatching at the boom to stay it, seemed madness. \nIt flew from right to left, and back again, almost in one \nticking of a watch, and every instant seemed on the point \nof snapping into splinters. Nothing was done, and noth- \ning seemed capable of being done ; those on deck rushed \ntoward the bows, and stood eyeing the boom as if it were \nthe lower jaw of an exasperated whale. In the midst of \nthis consternation, Queequeg dropped deftly to his knees, \nand crawling under the path of the boom, whipped hold \nof a rope, secured one end to the bulwarks, and then \nflinging the other like a lasso, caught it round the boom \nas it swept over his head, and at the next jerk, the spar \nwas that way trapped, and all was safe. The schooner \nwas run into the wind, and while the hands were clearing \naway the stern boat, Queequeg, stripped to the waist, \ndarted from the side with a long living arc of a leap. For \nthree minutes or more he was seen swimming like a dog, \nthrowing his long arms straight out before him, and by \nturns revealing his brawny shoulders through the freezing \nfoam. I looked at the grand and glorious fellow, but saw \nno one to be saved. The greenhorn had gone down. \nShooting himself perpendicularly from the water, Quee- \n\n\n\n76 MOBY-DICK \n\nqueg now took an instant's glance around him, and seem- \ning to see just how matters were, dived down and dis- \nappeared. A few minutes more, and he rose again, one \narm still striking out, and with the other dragging a life- \nless form. The boat soon picked them up. The poor \nbumpkin was restored. All hands voted Queequeg a \nnoble trump ; the captain begged his pardon. From \nthat hour I clove to Queequeg like a barnacle ; yea, till \npoor Queequeg took his last long dive. \n\nWas there ever such unconsciousness ? He did not \nseem to think that he at all deserved a medal from the \nHumane and Magnanimous Societies. He only asked for \nwater fresh water something to wipe the brine off ; \nthat done, he put on dry clothes, lighted his pipe, and \nleaning against the bulwarks, and mildly eyeing those \naround him, seemed to be saying to himself ' It 's a \nmutual, joint-stock world, in all meridians. We canni- \nbals must help these Christians. 5 \n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV \n\n\n\nNANTUCKET \n\nNOTHING more happened on the passage worthy the \nmentioning ; so, after a fine run, we safely arrived in \nNantucket. \n\nNantucket ! Take out your map and look at it. \nSee what a real corner of the world it occupies ; how it \nstands there, away off shore, more lonely than the Eddy- \nstone lighthouse. Look at it a mere hillock, and elbow \nof sand ; all beach, without a background. There is \nmore sand there than you would use in twenty years as a \nsubstitute for blotting-paper. Some gamesome wights \nwill tell you that they have to plant weeds there, they \ndon't grow naturally ; that they import Canada thistles ; \nthat they have to send beyond seas for a spile to stop a \nleak in an oil-cask ; that pieces of wood in Nantucket \nare carried about like bits of the true cross in Rome ; \nthat people there plant toadstools before their houses, \nto get under the shade in summer time ; that one blade \nof grass makes an oasis, three blades in a day's walk a \nprairie ; that they wear quicksand shoes, something like \nLaplander snow-shoes ; that they are so shut up, belted \nabout, every way enclosed, surrounded, and made an \nutter island of by the ocean, that to their very chairs and \ntables small clams will sometimes be found adhering, as \nto the backs of sea-turtles. But these extravaganzas \nonly show that Nantucket is no Illinois. \n\nLook now at the wondrous traditional story of how this \nisland was settled by the red men. Thus goes the legend. \n\n77 \n\n\n\n78 MOBY-DICK \n\nIn olden times an eagle swooped down upon the New \nEngland coast, and carried off an infant Indian in his \ntalons. With loud lament the parents saw their child \nborne out of sight over the wide waters. They resolved \nto follow in the same direction. Setting out in their \ncanoes, after a perilous passage they discovered the \nisland, and there they found an empty ivory casket, \nthe poor little Indian's skeleton. \n\nWhat wonder, then, that these Nantucketers, born on \na beach, should take to the sea for a livelihood ! They \nfirst caught crabs and quohogs in the sand ; grown \nbolder, they waded out with nets for mackerel ; more \nexperienced, they pushed off in boats and captured cod ; \nand at last, launching a navy of great ships on the sea, \nexplored this watery world ; put an incessant belt of cir- \ncumnavigations round it ; peeped in at Behring Straits ; \nand in all seasons and all oceans declared everlasting war \nwith the mightiest animated mass that has survived the \nFlood ; most monstrous and most mountainous ! That \nHimalayan, salt-sea mastodon, clothed with such por- \ntentousness of unconscious power, that his very panics \nare more to be dreaded than his most fearless and malicious \nassaults ! \n\nAnd thus have these naked Nantucketers, these sea- \nhermits, issuing from their ant-hill in the sea, overrun \nand conquered the watery world like so many Alexanders ; \nparcelling out among them the Atlantic, Pacific, and \nIndian oceans, as the three pirate powers did Poland. Let \nAmerica add Mexico to Texas, and pile Cuba upon Canada ; \nlet the English over swarm all India, and hang out their \nblazing banner from the sun; two-thirds of this terr- \naqueous globe are the Nantucketer's. For the sea is his ; \nhe owns it, as Emperors own empires ; other seamen \nhaving but a right of way through it. Merchant ships \nare but extension bridges ; armed ones but floating forts ; \n\n\n\nNANTUCKET 79 \n\neven pirates and privateers, though following the sea as \nhighwaymen the road, they but plunder other ships, other \nfragments of the land like themselves, without seeking to \ndraw their living from the bottomless deep itself. The \nNantucketer, he alone resides and riots on the sea ; he \nalone, in Bible language, goes down to it in ships ; to and \nfro ploughing it as his own special plantation. There is \nhis home ; there lies his business, which a Noah's flood \nwould not interrupt, though it overwhelmed all the \nmillions in China. He lives on the sea, as prairie cocks \nin the prairie ; he hides among the waves, he climbs \nthem as chamois hunters climb the Alps. For years he \nknows not the land ; so that when he comes to it at last, \nit smells like another world, more strangely than the \nmoon would to an Earthsman. With the landless gull, \nthat at sunset folds her wings and is rocked to sleep \nbetween billows ; so, at nightfall, the Nantucketer, out \nof sight of land, furls his sails, and lays him to his rest, \nwhile under his very pillow rush herds of walruses and \nwhales. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV \n\nCHOWDER \n\nIT was quite late in the evening when the little Moss came \nsnugly to anchor, and Queequeg and I went ashore ; so \nwe could attend to no business that day, at least none \nbut a supper and a bed. The landlord of the Spouter- \nInn had recommended us to his cousin Hosea Hussey \nof the Try Pots, whom he asserted to be the proprietor \nof one of the best kept hotels in all Nantucket, and more- \nover he had assured us that Cousin Hosea, as he called \nhim, was famous for his chowders. In short, he plainly \nhinted that we could not possibly do better than try pot- \nluck at the Try Pots. But the directions he had given \nus about keeping a yellow warehouse on our starboard \nhand till we opened a white church to the larboard, and \nthen keeping that on the larboard hand till we made a \ncorner three points to the starboard, and that done, \nthen ask the first man we met where the place was : these \ncrooked directions of his very much puzzled us at first, \nespecially as, at the outset, Queequeg insisted that the \nyellow warehouse our first point of departure must be \nleft on the larboard hand, whereas I had understood \nPeter Coffin to say it was on the starboard. However, \nby dint of beating about a little in the dark, and now and \nthen knocking up a peaceable inhabitant to inquire the \nway, we at last came to something which there was no \nmistaking. \n\nTwo enormous wooden pots painted black, and sus- \npended by asses' ears, swung from the cross-trees of an \n\n80 \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHOWDER 81 \n\nold topmast, planted in front of an old doorway. The \nhorns of the cross-trees were sawed off on the other side, \nso that this old topmast looked not a little like a gallows. \nPerhaps I was over-sensitive to such impressions at the \ntime, but I could not help staring at this gallows with a \nvague misgiving. A sort of crick was in my neck as I \ngazed up to the two remaining horns ; yes, two of them, \none for Queequeg, and one for me. It 's ominous, thinks \nI. A Coffin my Innkeeper upon landing in my first \nwhaling port ; tombstones staring at me in the whale- \nman's chapel ; and here a gallows ! and a pair of pro- \ndigious black pots too ! Are these last throwing out \noblique hints touching Tophet ? \n\nI was called from these reflections by the sight of a \nfreckled woman with yellow hair and a yellow gown, \nstanding in the porch of the inn, under a dull red lamp \nswinging there, that looked much like an injured eye, \nand carrying on a brisk scolding with a man in a purple \nwoollen shirt. \n\n1 Get along with ye, 5 said she to the man, ' or I '11 be \ncombing ye ! ' \n\n4 Come on, Queequeg,' said I, 'all right. There's \nMrs. Hussey.' \n\nAnd so it turned out ; Mr. Hosea Hussey being from \nhome, but leaving Mrs. Hussey entirely competent to \nattend to all his affairs. Upon making known our de- \nsires for a supper and a bed, Mrs. Hussey, postponing \nfurther scolding for the present, ushered us into a little \nroom, and seating us at a table spread with the relics \nof a recently concluded repast, turned round to us and \nsaid, ' Clam or cod ? ' \n\n' What 's that about cods, ma'am ? ' said I, with much \npoliteness. \n\n4 Clam or cod ? ' she repeated. \n\n' A clam for supper ? a cold clam ; is that what you \n\nVOL. I. F \n\n\n\n82 MOBY-DICK \n\nmean, Mrs. Hussey ? ' says I ; ' but that 's a rather cold \nand clammy reception in the winter time, ain't it, Mrs. \nHussey ? ' \n\nBut being in a great hurry to resume scolding the \nman in the purple shirt, who was waiting for it in \nthe entry, and seeming to hear nothing but the word \n' clam, 5 Mrs. Hussey hurried toward an open door \nleading to the kitchen, and bawling out ' clam for two, ' \ndisappeared. \n\n' Queequeg,' said I, ' do you think that we can make out \na supper for us both on one clam ? ' \n\nHowever, a warm savoury steam from the kitchen \nserved to belie the apparently cheerless prospect before \nus. But when that smoking chowder came in, the \nmystery was delightfully explained. Oh, sweet friends ! \nhearken to me. It was made of small juicy clams, \nscarcely bigger than hazel nuts, mixed with pounded ship- \nbiscuit, and salted pork cut up into little flakes ; the \nwhole enriched with butter, and plentifully seasoned with \npepper and salt. Our appetites being sharpened by the \nfrosty voyage, and in particular, Queequeg seeing his \nfavourite fishing food before him, and the chowder being \nsurpassingly excellent, we dispatched it with great \nexpedition : when leaning back a moment and bethink- \ning me of Mrs. Hussey's clam and cod announcement, \nI thought I would try a little experiment. Stepping \nto the kitchen door, I uttered the word ' cod ' with great \nemphasis, and resumed my seat. In a few moments the \nsavoury steam came forth again, but with a different \nflavour, and in good time a fine cod-chowder was placed \nbefore us. \n\nWe resumed business ; and while plying our spoons \nin the bowl, thinks I to myself, I wonder now if this here \nhas any effect on the head ? What 's that stultifying \nsaying about chowder-headed people ? ' But look, \n\n\n\nCHOWDER 83 \n\nQueequeg, ain't that a live eel in your bowl ? Where 's \nyour harpoon ? ' \n\nFishiest of all fishy places was the Try Pots; which well \ndeserved its name ; for the pots there were always boiling \nchowders. Chowder for breakfast, and chowder for \ndinner, and chowder for supper, till you began to look for \nfish-bones coming through your clothes. The area before \nthe house was paved with clam-shells. Mrs. Hussey wore \na polished necklace of codfish vertebra ; and Hosea \nHussey had his account-books bound in superior old \nshark-skin. There was a fishy flavour to the milk, too, \nwhich I could not at all account for, till one morning \nhappening to take a stroll along the beach among some \nfishermen's boats, I saw Hosea 's brindled cow feeding \non fish remnants, and marching along the sand with each \nfoot in a cod's decapitated head, looking very slipshod, \nI assure ye. \n\nSupper concluded, we received a lamp, and directions \nfrom Mrs. Hussey concerning the nearest way to bed ; \nbut, as Queequeg was about to precede me up the stairs, \nthe lady reached forth her arm, and demanded his har- \npoon ; she allowed no harpoon in her chambers. ' Why \nnot ? J said I ; ' every true whaleman sleeps with his \nharpoon but why not ? ' ' Because it 's dangerous, 5 \nsays she. ' Ever since young Stiggs coming from that \nunfort'nt v'y'ge of his, when he was gone four years and \na half, with only three barrels of ile, was found dead in \nmy first floor back, with his harpoon in his side ; ever \nsince then I allow no boarders to take sich dangerous \nweepons in their rooms at night. So, Mr. Queequeg ' \n(for she had learned his name), ' I will just take this \nhere iron, and keep it for you till morning. But the \nchowder ; clam or cod to-morrow for breakfast, men ? ' \n\n' Both,' says I ; ' and let 's have a couple of smoked \nherring by way of variety.' \n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI \n\nTHE SHIP \n\nIN bed we concocted our plans for the morrow. But to \nmy surprise and no small concern, Queequeg now gave \nme to understand, that he had been diligently consulting \nYojo the name of his black little god and Yojo had \ntold him two or three times over, and strongly insisted \nupon it everyway, that instead of our going together \namong the whaling-fleet in harbour, and in concert \nselecting our craft ; instead of this, I say, Yojo earnestly \nenjoined that the selection of the ship should rest wholly \nwith me, inasmuch as Yojo purposed befriending us ; and, \nin order to do so, had already pitched upon a vessel, which, \nif left to myself, I, Ishmael, should infallibly light upon, \nfor all the world as though it had turned out by chance ; \nand in that vessel I must immediately ship myself, for \nthe present irrespective of Queequeg. \n\nI have forgotten to mention that, in many things, \nQueequeg placed great confidence in the excellence of \nYojo's judgment and surprising forecast of things ; and \ncherished Yojo with considerable esteem, as a rather \ngood sort of god, who perhaps meant well enough upon \nthe whole, but in all cases did not succeed in his benevolent \ndesigns. \n\nNow, this plan of Queequeg's, or rather Yojo's, touch- \ning the selection of our craft ; I did not like that plan at \nall. I had not a little relied upon Queequeg's sagacity \nto point out the whaler best fitted to carry us and our \nfortunes securely. But as all my remonstrances pro- \n\n84 \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE SHIP 85 \n\nduced no effect upon Queequeg, I was obliged to acquiesce; \nand accordingly prepared to set about this business with \na determined rushing sort of energy and vigour, that \nshould quickly settle that trifling little affair. Next \nmorning early, leaving Queequeg shut up with Yojo in \nour little bedroom for it seemed that it was some sort \nof Lent or Ramadan, or day of fasting, humiliation, and \nprayer with Queequeg and Yojo that day ; how it was \nI never could find out, for, though I applied myself to \nit several times, I never could master his liturgies and \nXXXIX Articles leaving Queequeg, then, fasting on \nhis tomahawk-pipe, and Yojo warming himself at his \nsacrificial fire of shavings, I sallied out among the shipping. \nAfter much prolonged sauntering and many random \ninquiries, I learnt that there were three ships up for \nthree-years' voyages the Devil-Dam, the Tit-bit, and \nthe Pequod. Devil-Dam, I do not know the origin of ; \nTit-bit is obvious ; Pequod, you will no doubt remember, \nwas the name of a celebrated tribe of Massachusetts \nIndians, now extinct as the ancient Medes. I peered and \npryed about the Devil-Dam ; from her, hopped over to \nthe Tit-bit ; and, finally, going on board the Pequod, \nlooked around her for a moment, and then decided that \nthis was the very ship for us. \n\nYou may have seen many a quaint craft in your day, \nfor aught I know ; square-toed luggers ; mountainous \nJapanese junks ; butter-box galliots, and what not ; but \ntake my word for it, you never saw such a rare old craft \nas this same rare old Pequod. She was a ship of the old \nschool, rather small if anything ; with an old-fashioned \nclaw-footed look about her. Long seasoned and weather- \nstained in the typhoons and calms of all four oceans, her \nold hull's complexion was darkened like a French grena- \ndier's, who has alike fought in Egypt and Siberia. Her \nvenerable bows looked bearded. Her masts cut some- \n\n\n\n86 MOBY-DICK \n\nwhere on the coast of Japan, where her original ones were \nlost overboard in a gale her masts stood stiffly up like \nthe spines of the three old kings of Cologne. Her ancient \ndecks were worn and wrinkled, like the pilgrim-worshipped \nflag-stone in Canterbury Cathedral where Becket bled. \nBut to all these her old antiquities were added new and \nmarvellous features, pertaining to the wild business that \nfor more than half a century she had followed. Old \nCaptain Peleg, many years her chief mate, before he com- \nmanded another vessel of his own, and now a retired \nseaman, and one of the principal owners of the Pequod, \nthis old Peleg, during the term of his chief mateship, had \nbuilt upon her original grotesqueness, and inlaid it, all \nover, with a quaintness both of material and device, un- \nmatched by anything except it be Thorkill-Hake's carved \nbuckler or bedstead. She was apparelled like any bar- \nbaric Ethiopian emperor, his neck heavy with pendants \nof polished ivory. She was a thing of trophies. A canni- \nbal of a craft, tricking herself forth in the chased bones \nof her enemies. All round, her unpanelled, open bul- \nwarks were garnished like one continuous jaw, with the \nlong sharp teeth of the sperm whale, inserted there for \npins, to fasten her old hempen thews and tendons to. \nThose thews ran not through base blocks of land-wood, \nbut deftly travelled over sheaves of sea -ivory. Scorning \na turnstile wheel at her reverend helm, she sported there \na tiller ; and that tiller was in one mass, curiously carved \nfrom the long narrow lower jaw of her hereditary foe. \nThe helmsman who steered by that tiller in a tempest, \nfelt like the Tartar, when he holds back his fiery steed \nby clutching its jaw. A noble craft, but somehow a most \nmelancholy ! All noble things are touched with that. \n\nNow when I looked about the quarter-deck, for some \none having authority, in order to propose myself as a \ncandidate for the voyage, at first I saw nobody ; but I \n\n\n\nTHE SHIP 87 \n\ncould not well overlook a strange sort of tent, or rather \nwigwam, pitched a little behind the mainmast. It \nseemed only a temporary erection used in port. It was \nof a conical shape, some ten feet high ; consisting of the \nlong, huge slabs of limber black bone taken from the \nmiddle and highest part of the jaws of the right whale. \nPlanted with their broad ends on the deck, a circle of these \nslabs laced together, mutually sloped toward each other, \nand at the apex united in a tufted point, where the loose \nhairy fibres waved to and fro like the top-knot on some \nold Pottowottamie sachem's head. A triangular opening \nfaced toward the bows of the ship, so that the insider \ncommanded a complete view forward. \n\nAnd half concealed in this queer tenement, I at length \nfound one who by his aspect seemed to have authority ; \nand who, it being noon, and the ship's work suspended, \nwas now enjoying respite from the burden of command. \nHe was seated on an old-fashioned oaken chair, wriggling \nall over with curious carving ; and the bottom of which \nwas formed of a stout interlacing of the same elastic stuff \nof which the wigwam was constructed. \n\nThere was nothing so very particular, perhaps, about \nthe appearance of the elderly man I saw ; he was brown \nand brawny, like most old seamen, and heavily rolled up \nin blue pilot-cloth, cut in the Quaker style ; only there \nwas a fine and almost microscopic network of the minutest \nwrinkles interlacing round his eyes, which must have \narisen from his continual sailings in many hard gales, and \nalways looking to windward ; for this causes the muscles \nabout the eyes to become pursed together. Such eye- \nwrinkles are very effectual in a scowl. \n\n' Is this the captain of the Pequod ? ' said I, advancing \nto the door of the tent. \n\n' Supposing it be the captain of the Pequod, what \ndost thou want of him ? ' he demanded. \n\n\n\n88 MOBY-DICK \n\n' I was thinking of shipping.' \n\n' Thou wast, wast thou ? I see thou art no Nan- \ntucketer ever been in a stove boat ? ' \n\n' No, sir, I never have.' \n\n' Dost know nothing at all about whaling, I dare say \neh? ' \n\n' Nothing, sir ; but I have no doubt I shall soon learn. \nI 've been several voyages in the merchant service, and \nI think that \n\n' Marchant service be damned. Talk not that lingo \nto me. Dost see that leg ? I '11 take that leg away from \nthy stern, if ever thou talkest of the marchant service to \nme again. Marchant service indeed ! I suppose now \nye feel considerable proud of having served in those \nmarchant ships. But flukes ! man, what makes thee \nwant to go a-whaling, eh ? it looks a little suspicious, \ndon't it, eh ? Hast not been a pirate, hast thou ? \nDidst not rob thy last captain, didst thou ? Dost not \nthink of murdering the officers when thou gettest to sea ? ' \n\nI protested my innocence of these things. I saw that \nunder the mask of these half-humorous innuendoes, this \nold seaman, as an insulated Quakerish Nantucketer, was \nfull of his insular prejudices, and rather distrustful of all \naliens, unless they hailed from Cape Cod or the Vineyard. \n\n' But what takes thee a-whaling ? I want to know that \nbefore I think of shipping ye.' \n\n4 Well, sir, I want to see what whaling is. I want to \nsee the world/ \n\n' Want to see what whaling is, eh ? Have ye clapped \neye on Captain Ahab ? ' \n\n' Who is Captain Ahab, sir ? ' \n\n4 Ay, ay, I thought so. Captain Ahab is the captain \nof this ship.' \n\n' I am mistaken then. I thought I was speaking to \nthe captain himself.' \n\n\n\nTHE SHIP 89 \n\n' Thou art speaking to Captain Peleg that 's who ye \nare speaking to, young man. It belongs to me and \nCaptain Bildad to see the Pequod fitted out for the voyage, \nand supplied with all her needs, including crew. We are \npart owners and agents. But as I was going to say, if \nthou wantest to know what whaling is, as thou tellest ye \ndo, I can put ye in a way of finding it out before ye bind \nyourself to it, past backing out. Clap eye on Captain \nAhab, young man, and thou wilt finxl that he has only \none leg.' \n\n' What do you mean, sir ? Was the other one lost by \na whale ? ' \n\n' Lost by a whale ! Young man, come nearer to me : \nit was devoured, chewed up, crunched by the mon- \nstrousest parmacetty that ever chipped a boat ! ah, ah ! ' \n\nI was a little alarmed by his energy, perhaps also a little \ntouched at the hearty grief in his concluding exclamation, \nbut said as calmly as I could, ' What you say is no doubt \ntrue enough, sir ; but how could I know there was any \npeculiar ferocity in that particular whale, though indeed \nI might have inferred as much from the simple fact of \nthe accident.' \n\n' Look ye now, young man, thy lungs are a sort of soft, \nd' ye see ; thou dost not talk shark a bit. Sure, ye 've \nbeen to sea before now ; sure of that ? ' \n\n' Sir,' said I, ' I thought I told you that I had been four \nvoyages in the merchant ' \n\n' Hard down out of that ! Mind what I said about the \nmarchant service don't aggravate me I won't have it. \nBut let us understand each other. I have given thee a \nhint about what whaling is ; do ye yet feel inclined for it ? ' \n\n4 1 do, sir.' \n\n' Very good. Now, art thou the man to pitch a \nharpoon down a live whale's throat, and then jump \nafter it ? Answer, quick ! ' \n\n\n\n90 MOBY-DICK \n\n' I am, sir, if it should be positively indispensable to \ndo so ; not to be got rid of, that is ; which I don't take \nto be the fact.' \n\n6 Good again. Now then, thou not only wantest to go \na -whaling, to find out by experience what whaling is, \nbut ye also want to go in order to see the world ? Was \nnot that what ye said ? I thought so. Well then, just \nstep forward there, and take a peep over the weather-bow, \nand then back to me and tell me what ye see there.' \n\nFor a moment I stood a little puzzled by this curious \nrequest, not knowing exactly how to take it, whether \nhumorously or in earnest. But concentrating all his \ncrow's feet into one scowl, Captain Peleg started me on \nthe errand. \n\nGoing forward and glancing over the weather -bow, I \nperceived that the ship, swinging to her anchor with the \nflood-tide, was now obliquely pointing toward the open \nocean. The prospect was unlimited, but exceedingly \nmonotonous and forbidding ; not the slightest variety \nthat I could see. \n\n' Well, what 's the report ? ' said Peleg when I came \nback ; ' what did ye see ? ' \n\n1 Not much,' I replied 'nothing but water ; considerable \nhorizon though, and there 's a squall coming up, I think.' \n\n' Well, what dost thou think then of seeing the world ? \nDo ye wish to go round Cape Horn to see any more of it, \nI eh ? Can't ye see the world where you stand ? ' \n\nI was a little staggered, but go a-whaling I must, and \nI would ; and the Pequod was as good a ship as any I \n\n(thought the best and all this I now repeated to Peleg. \nSeeing me so determined, he expressed his willingness to \nship me. \n\n' And thou mayest as well sign the papers right off, ' he \nadded ' come along with ye.' And so saying, he led \nthe way below deck into the cabin. \n\n\n\nTHE SHIP 91 \n\nSeated on the transom was what seemed to me a most \nuncommon and surprising figure. It turned out to be \nCaptain Bildad, who along with Captain Peleg was one \nof the largest owners of the vessel ; the other shares, as \nis sometimes the case in these ports, being held by a \ncrowd of old annuitants ; widows, fatherless children, \nand chancery wards ; each owning about the value of a \ntimber head, or a foot of plank, or a nail or two in the ship. \nPeople in Nantucket invest their money in whaling- \nvessels, the same way that you do yours in approved \nstate stocks bringing in good interest. \n\nNow Bildad, like Peleg, and indeed many other Nan- \ntucketers, was a Quaker, the island having been originally \nsettled by that sect ; and to this day its inhabitants in \ngeneral retain in an uncommon measure the peculiarities \nof the Quaker, only variously and anomalously modified \nby things altogether alien and heterogeneous. For some \nof these same Quakers are the most sanguinary of all \nsailors and whale -hunters. They are fighting Quakers ; \nthey are Quakers with a vengeance. \n\nSo that there are instances among them of men, who, \nnamed with Scripture names a singularly common \nfashion on the island and in childhood naturally imbib- \ning the stately dramatic thee and thou of the Quaker \nidiom ; still, from the audacious, daring, and boundless \nadventure of their subsequent lives, strangely blend with \nthese unoutgrown peculiarities a thousand bold dashes \nof character, not unworthy a Scandinavian sea-king, or a \npoetical pagan Roman. And when these things unite \nin a man of greatly superior natural force, with a globular \nbrain and a ponderous heart ; who has also by the still- \nness and seclusion of many long night-watches in the \nremotest waters, and beneath constellations never seen \nhere at the north, been led to think untraditionally and \nindependently ; receiving all nature's sweet or savage \n\n\n\n92 MOBY-DICK \n\nimpressions fresh from her own virgin voluntary and \nconfiding breast, and thereby chiefly, but with some help \nfrom accidental advantages, to learn a bold and nervous \nlofty language that man makes one in a whole nation's \ncensus a mighty pageant creature, formed for noble \ntragedies. Nor will it at all detract from him, dramatic- \nally regarded, if either by birth or other circumstances, he \nhave what seems a half- wilful over-ruling morbidness at \nthe bottom of his nature. For all men tragically great \nare made so through a certain morbidness. Be sure of \nthis, young ambition, all mortal greatness is but disease. \nBut, as yet we have not to do with such an one, but with \nquite another ; and still a man, who, if indeed peculiar, \nit only results again from another phase of the Quaker, \nmodified by individual circumstances. \n\nLike Captain Peleg, Captain Bildad was a well-to-do, \nretired whaleman. But unlike Captain Peleg who \ncared not a rush for what are called serious things, and \nindeed deemed those self-same serious things the veriest \nof all trifles Captain Bildad had not only been originally \neducated according to the strictest sect of Nantucket \nQuakerism, but all his subsequent ocean life ; and the sight \nof many unclad, lovely island creatures, round the Horn \nall that had not moved this native-born Quaker one \nsingle jot, had not so much as altered one angle of his vest. \nStill, for all this immutableness, was there some lack of \ncommon consistency about worthy Captain Bildad. \nThough refusing, from conscientious scruples, to bear \narms against land invaders, yet himself had illimitably \ninvaded the Atlantic and Pacific ; and though a sworn \nfoe to human bloodshed, yet had he in his straight -bodied \ncoat, spilled tuns upon tuns of leviathan gore. How \nnow in the contemplative evening of his days, the pious \nBildad reconciled these things in the reminiscence, I do \nnot know ; but it did not seem to concern him much, \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE SHIP 93 \n\nand very probably he had long since come to the sage and \nsensible conclusion that a Oman's religion is one thing, \nand this practical world quite another. This world pays \ndividends. Rising from a little cabin-boy in short clothes \nof the drabbest drab, to a harpooneer in a broad shad- \nbellied waistcoat ; from that becoming boat-header, \nchief mate, and captain, and finally a shipowner ; Bildad, \nas I hinted before, had concluded his adventurous career \nby wholly retiring from active life at the goodly age of \nsixty, and dedicating his remaining days to the quiet \nreceiving of his well-earned income. \n\nNow Bildad, I am sorry to say, had the reputation of \nbeing an incorrigible old hunks, and in his sea -going days, \na bitter, hard taskmaster. They told me in Nantucket, \nthough it certainly seems a curious story, that when he \nsailed the old Categut whaleman, his crew, upon arriving \nhome, were mostly all carried ashore to the hospital, \nsore exhausted and worn out. For a pious man, especi- v \nally for a Quaker, he was certainly rather hard-hearted, to \\ \nsay the least. He never used to swear, though, at his \nmen, they said ; but somehow he got an inordinate \nquantity of cruel, unmitigated hard work out of them. \nWhen Bildad was a chief mate, to have his drab-coloured \neye intently looking at you, made you feel completely \nnervous, till you could clutch something a hammer or a \nmarling-spike and go to work like mad, at something or \nother, never mind what. Indolence and idleness perished \nfrom before him. His own person was the exact embodi- \nment of his utilitarian character. On his long, gaunt \nbody he carried no spare flesh, no superfluous beard, \nhis chin having a soft, economical nap to it, like the worn \nnap of his broad-brimmed hat. \n\nSuch, then, was the person that I saw seated on the \ntransom when I followed Captain Peleg down into the \ncabin. The space between the decks was small ; and \n\n\n\n94 MOBY-DICK \n\nthere, bolt-upright, sat old Bildad, who always sat so, \nand never leaned, and this to save his coat-tails. His \nbroad-brim was placed beside him ; his legs were stiffly \ncrossed ; his drab vesture was buttoned up to his chin ; \nand spectacles on nose, he seemed absorbed in reading \nfrom a ponderous volume. \n\n' Bildad,' cried Captain Peleg, ' at it again, Bildad, eh ? \nYe have been studying those Scriptures, now, for the last \nthirty years, to my certain knowledge. How far ye got, \nBildad ? ' \n\nAs if long habituated to such profane talk from his old \nshipmate, Bildad, without noticing his present irreverence, \nquietly looked up, and seeing me, glanced again inquiringly \ntoward Peleg. \n\n4 He says he 's our man, Bildad/ said Peleg, ' he wants \nto ship. 5 \n\n' Dost thee ? ' said Bildad, in a hollow tone, and turning \nround to me. \n\n' I dost/ said I unconsciously, he was so intense a \nQuaker. \n\n' What do ye think of him, Bildad ? ' said Peleg. \n\n' He '11 do,' said Bildad, eyeing me, and then went on \nspelling away at his book in a mumbling tone quite \naudible. \n\nI thought him the queerest old Quaker I ever saw, \nespecially as Peleg, his friend and old shipmate, seemed \nsuch a blusterer. But I said nothing, only looking round \nme sharply. Peleg now threw open a chest, and drawing \nforth the ship's articles, placed pen and ink before him, \nand seated himself at a little table. I began to think \nit was high time to settle with myself at what terms I \nwould be willing to engage for the voyage. I was already \naware that in the whaling business they paid no wages ; \nbut all hands, including the captain, received certain \nshares of the profits called lays, and that these lays were \n\n\n\nTHE SHIP 95 \n\nproportioned to the degree of importance pertaining to \nthe respective duties of the ship's company. I was also \naware that being a green-hand at whaling, my own lay \nwould not be very large ; but considering that I was used \nto the sea, could steer a ship, splice a rope, and all that, \nI made no doubt that from all I had heard I should be \noffered at least the 275th lay that is, the 275th part of \nthe clear nett proceeds of the voyage, whatever that \nmight eventually amount to. And though the 275th \nlay was what they call a rather long lay, yet it was better \nthan nothing ; and if we had a lucky voyage, might \npretty nearly pay for the clothing I would wear out on it, \nnot to speak of my three years' beef and board, for which \nI would not have to pay one stiver. \n\nIt might be thought that this was a poor way to \naccumulate a princely fortune and so it was, a very poor \nway indeed. But I am one of those that never take on \nabout princely fortunes, and am quite content if the world \nis ready to board and lodge me, while I am putting up at \nthis grim sign of the Thunder Cloud. Upon the whole, I \nthought that the 275th lay would be about the fair thing, \nbut would not have been surprised had I been offered \nthe 200th, considering I was of a broad-shouldered make. \n\nBut one thing, nevertheless, that made me a little \ndistrustful about receiving a generous share of the profits \nwas this : Ashore, I had heard something of both Captain \nPeleg and his unaccountable old crony Bildad ; how that \nthey being the principal proprietors of the Pequod, there- \nfore the other and more inconsiderable and scattered \nowners, left nearly the whole management of the ship's \naffairs to these two. And I did not know but what the \nstingy old Bildad might have a mighty deal to say about \nshipping hands, especially as I now found him on board \nthe Pequod, quite at home there in the cabin, and reading \nhis Bible as if at his own fireside. Now while Peleg was \n\n\n\n96 MOBY-DICK \n\nvainly trying to mend a pen with his jack-knife, old Bildad, \nto my no small surprise, considering that he was such an \ninterested party in these proceedings ; Bildad never \nheeded us, but went on mumbling to himself out of his \nbook, ' Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, \nwhere moth ' \n\n' Well, Captain Bildad,' interrupted Peleg, ' what d' ye \nsay, what lay shall we give this young man ? ' \n\n' Thou knowest best,' was the sepulchral reply, ' the \nseven hundred and seventy-seventh wouldn't be too \nmuch, would it ? \" where moth and rust do corrupt, \nbut lay \" ' \n\nLay, indeed, thought I, and such a lay ! the seven \nhundred and seventy-seventh ! Well, old Bildad, you \nare determined that I, for one, shall not lay up many lays \nhere below, where moth and rust do corrupt. It was an \nexceedingly long lay that, indeed ; and though from the \nmagnitude of the figure it might at first deceive a lands- \nman, yet the slightest consideration will show that though \nseven hundred and seventy -seven is a pretty large num- \nber, yet, when you come to make a teenth of it, you will \nthen see, I say, that the seven hundred and seventy- \nseventh part of a farthing is a good deal less than seven \nhundred and seventy -seven gold doubloons ; and so I \nthought at the time. \n\n4 Why, blast your eyes, Bildad,' cried Peleg, ' thou dost \nnot want to swindle this young man ! he must have more \nthan that.' \n\n' Seven hundred and seventy -seventh,' again said \nBildad, without lifting his eyes ; and then went on \nmumbling ' for where your treasure is, there will your \nheart be also.' \n\n' I am going to put him down for the three hundredth,' \nsaid Peleg, ' do ye hear that, Bildad ? The three hundredth \nlay, I say.' \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE SHIP 97 \n\nBildad laid down his book, and turning solemnly to- \nward him said, ' Captain Peleg, thou hast a generous \nheart ; but thou must consider the duty thou owest to \nthe other owners of this ship widows and orphans; many \nof them and that if we too abundantly reward the \nlabours of this young man, we may be taking the bread \nfrom those widows and those orphans. The seven \nhundred and seventy -seventh lay, Captain Peleg.' \n\n' Thou Bildad ! ' roared Peleg, starting up and clattering \nabout the cabin. ' Blast ye, Captain Bildad, if I had \nfollowed thy advice in these matters, I would afore now \nhad a conscience to lug about that would be heavy \nenough to founder the largest ship that ever sailed round \nCape Horn.' \n\n4 Captain Peleg,' said Bildad steadily, ' thy conscience \nmay be drawing ten inches of water, or ten fathoms, I \ncan't tell ; but as thou art still an impenitent man, \nCaptain Peleg, I greatly fear lest thy conscience be but \na leaky one ; and will in the end sink thee foundering \ndown to the fiery pit, Captain Peleg.' \n\n' Fiery pit ! fiery pit ! ye insult me, man ; past all \nnatural bearing, ye insult me. It 's an all-fired outrage \nto tell any human creature that he 's bound to hell. \nFlukes and flames ! Bildad, say that again to me, and \nstart my soul-bolts, but I '11 I '11 yes, I '11 swallow a \nlive goat with all his hair and horns on. Out of the cabin, \nye canting, drab-coloured son of a wooden gun \u0026 straight \nwake with ye ! ' \n\nAs he thundered out this he made a rush at Bildad, but \nwith a marvellous oblique, sliding celerity, Bildad for \nthat time eluded him. \n\nAlarmed at this terrible outburst between the two \nprincipal and responsible owners of the ship, and feeling \nhalf a mind to give up all idea of sailing in a vessel so \nquestionably owned and temporarily commanded, I \n\nVOL. i. G \n\n\n\n98 MOBY-DICK \n\nstepped aside from the door to give egress to Bildad, who, \nI made no doubt, was all eagerness to vanish from before \nthe awakened wrath of Peleg. But to my astonishment, \nhe sat down again on the transom very quietly, and seemed \nto have not the slightest intention of withdrawing. He \nseemed quite used to impenitent Peleg and his ways. As \nfor Peleg, after letting off his rage as he had, there seemed \nno more left in him, and he, too, sat down like a lamb, \nthough he twitched a little as if still nervously agitated. \n' Whew ! ' he whistled at last ' the squall 's gone off to \nleeward, I think. Bildad, thou used to be good at \nsharpening a lance, mend that pen, will ye. My jack- \nknife here needs the grindstone. That 's he ; thank ye, \nBildad. Now then, my young man, Ishmael 's thy name, \ndidn't ye say ? Well then, down ye go here, Ishmael, \nfor the three hundredth lay.' \n\n' Captain Peleg,' said I, ' I have a friend with me who \nwants to ship too shall I bring him down to-morrow ? ' \n\n' To be sure,' said Peleg. ' Fetch him along, and we '11 \nlook at him.' \n\n' What lay does he want ? ' groaned Bildad, glancing \nup from the book in which he had again been burying \nhimself. \n\n* Oh ! never thee mind about that, Bildad,' said Peleg. \n' Has he ever whaled it any ? ' turning to me. \n\n' Killed more whales than I can count, Captain Peleg.' \n\n' Well, bring him along then.' \n\nAnd, after signing the papers, off I went ; nothing \ndoubting but that I had done a good morning's work, \nand that the Pequod was the identical ship that Yojo \nhad provided to carry Queequeg and me round the Cape. \n\nBut I had not proceeded far, when I began to bethink \nme that the captain with whom I was to sail yet remained \nunseen by me ; though, indeed, in many cases, a whale- \nship will be completely fitted out, and receive all her crew \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE SHIP 99 \n\non board, ere the captain makes himself visible by arriv- \ning to take command ; for sometimes these voyages are \nso prolonged, and the shore intervals at home so exceed- \ningly brief, that if the captain have a family, or any \nabsorbing concernment of that sort, he does not trouble \nhimself much about his ship in port, but leaves her to \nthe owners till all is ready for sea. However, it is always \nas well to have a look at him before irrevocably commit- \nting yourself into his hands. Turning back I accosted \nCaptain Peleg, inquiring where Captain Ahab was to be \nfound. \n\n* And what dost thou want of Captain Ahab ? It 's \nall right enough ; thou art shipped.' \n\n' Yes, but I should like to see him. 3 \n\n' But I don't think thou wilt be able to at present. I \ndon't know exactly what 's the matter with him ; but \nhe keeps close inside the house ; a sort of sick, and yet he \ndon't look so. In fact, he ain't sick ; but no, he isn't well \neither. Anyhow, young man, he won't always see me, \nso I don't suppose he will thee. He 's a queer man, \nCaptain Ahab so some think but a good one. Oh, \nthou 'It like him well enough ; no fear, no fear. He 's a \ngrand, ungodly, god-like man, Captain Ahab ; doesn't \nspeak much ; but, when he does speak, then you may well \nlisten. Mark ye, be forewarned ; Ahab 's above the \ncommon ; Ahab 's been in colleges, as well as 'mong the \ncannibals ; been used to deeper wonders than the waves ; \nfixed his fiery lance hi mightier, stranger foes than whales. \nHis lance ! ay, the keenest and the surest that out of \nall our isle ! Oh ! he ain't Captain Bildad ; no, and he \nain't Captain Peleg ; he 's Ahab, boy ; and Ahab of old, \nthou knowest, was a crowned king ! ' \n\n' And a very vile one. When that wicked king was \nslain, the dogs, did they not lick his blood ? ' \n\n1 Come hither to me hither, hither,' said Peleg, with \n\n\n\n100 MOBY-DICK \n\na significance in his eye that almost startled me. ' Look \nye, lad ; never say that on board the Pequod. Never say \nit anywhere. Captain Ahab did not name himself. \n'Twas a foolish, ignorant whim of his crazy, widowed \nmother, who died when he was only a twelvemonth old. \nAnd yet the old squaw Tistig, at Gay Head, said that the \nname would somehow prove prophetic. And, perhaps, \nother fools like her may tell thee the same. I wish to \nwarn thee. It 's a lie. I know Captain Ahab well ; I 've \nsailed with him as mate years ago ; I know what he is a \ngood man not a pious, good man, like Bildad, but a \nswearing good man something like me only there 's a \ngood deal more of him. Ay, ay, I know that he was \nnever very jolly ; and I know that on the passage home, \nhe was a little out of his mind for a spell ; but it was the \nsharp shooting pains in his bleeding stump that brought \nthat about, as anyone might see. I know, too, that ever \nsince he lost his leg last voyage by that accursed whale, \nhe ? s been a kind of moody desperate moody, and savage \nsometimes ; but that will all pass off. And once for all, \nlet me tell thee and assure thee, young man, it 's better \nto sail with a moody good captain than a laughing bad \none. So good-bye to thee and wrong not Captain \nAhab, because he happens to have a wicked name. Be- \nsides, my boy, he has a wife not three voyages wedded \na_ sweet, resigned girl. Think of that ; by that sweet \ngirl that old man has a child : hold ye then there can be \nany utter, hopeless harm in Ahab ? No, no, my lad ; \nstricken, blasted, if he be, Ahab has his humanities ! ' \n\nAs I walked away, I was full of thoughtfuhiess ; what \nhad been incidentally revealed to me of Captain Ahab, \nfilled me with a certain wild vagueness of painfulness \nconcerning him. And somehow, at the time, I felt a \nsympathy and a sorrow for him, but for I don't know \nwhat, ^unless it was the cruel loss of his leg. And yet I \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE SHIP 101 \n\nalso felt a strange awe of him ; but that sort of awe, \nwhich I cannot at all describe, was not exactly awe ; I \ndo not know what it was. But I felt it ; and it did not \ndisincline me toward him ; though I felt impatience \nat what seemed like mystery in him, so imperfectly as \nhe was known to me then. However, my thoughts were \nat length carried in other directions, so that for the present \ndark Ahab slipped my mind. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII \n\nTHE RAMADAN \n\nAs Queequeg 's Ramadan, or Fasting and Humiliation, \nwas to continue all day, I did not choose to disturb him \ntill toward night -fall ; for I cherish the greatest respect \ntoward everybody's religious obligations, never mind \nhow comical, and could not find it in my heart to under- \nvalue even a congregation of ants worshipping a toad- \nstool ; or those other creatures in certain parts of our \nearth, who with a degree of footmanism quite unpre- \ncedented in other planets, bow down before the torso \nof a deceased landed proprietor merely on account of \nthe inordinate possessions yet owned and rented in his \nname. \n\nI say, we good Presbyterian Christians should be \ncharitable in these things, and not fancy ourselves so \nvastly superior to other mortals, pagans and what not, \nbecause of their half -crazy conceits on these subjects. \nThere was Queequeg, now, certainly entertaining the most \nabsurd notions about Yojo and his Ramadan ; but what \nof that ? Queequeg thought he knew what he was about, \nI suppose ; he seemed to be content ; and there let him \nrest. All our arguing with him would not avail ; let him \nbe, I say : and Heaven have mercy on us all Presby- \nterians and pagans alike for we are all somehow dread- \nfully cracked about the head, and sadly need mending. \n\nToward evening, when I felt assured that all his \nperformances and rituals must be over, I went up to his \nroom and knocked at the door ; but no answer. I tried \n102 \n\n\n\ni \n\n\n\nTHE RAMADAN 103 \n\nto open it, but it was fastened inside. ' Queequeg,' said I \nsoftly through the keyhole : all silent. ' I say, Quee- \nqueg ! why don't you speak ? It 's I Ishmael.' But \nall remained still as before. I began to grow alarmed. I \nhad allowed him such abundant time ; I thought he might \nhave had an apoplectic fit. I looked through the key- \nhole ; but the door opening into an odd corner of the \nroom, the keyhole prospect was but a crooked and sinister \none. I could only see part of the foot-board of the bed \nand a line of the wall, but nothing more. I was surprised \nto behold resting against the wall the wooden shaft of Quee- \nqueg 's harpoon, which the landlady the evening previous \nhad taken from him, before our mounting to the chamber. \nThat 's strange, thought I ; but at any rate, since the \nharpoon stands yonder, and he seldom or never goes \nabroad without it, therefore he must be inside here, and \nno possible mistake. \n\n' Queequeg ! Queequeg ! ' all still. Something must \nhave happened. Apoplexy ! I tried to burst open the \ndoor ; but it stubbornly resisted. Running downstairs, \nI quickly stated my suspicions to the first person I met \nthe chambermaid. ' La ! la ! ' she cried, ' I thought \nsomething must be the matter. I went to make the bed \nafter breakfast, and the door was locked ; and not a \nmouse to be heard ; and it 's been just so silent ever since. \nBut I thought, maybe, you had both gone off and locked \nyour baggage in for safe keeping. La ! la, ma'am ! \nMistress ! murder ! Mrs. Hussey ! apoplexy ! ' and \nwith these cries, she ran toward the kitchen, I following. \n\nMrs. Hussey soon appeared, with a mustard-pot in one \nhand and a vinegar-cruet in the other, having just broken \naway from the occupation of attending to the castors, \nand scolding her little black boy meantime. \n\n' Wood-house ! ' cried I, ' which way to it ? Run, for \nGod's sake, and fetch something to pry open the door \n\n\n\n104 MOBY-DICK \n\nthe axe ! the axe ! he 's had a stroke ; depend upon \nit ! ' and so saying I was unmethodically rushing up- \nstairs again empty-handed, when Mrs. Hussey interposed \nthe mustard-pot and vinegar-cruet, and the entire castor \nof her countenance. \n\n' What J s the matter with you, young man ? ' \n\n' Get the axe ! For God's sake, run for the doctor, \nsomeone, while I pry it open ! ' \n\n' Look here/ said the landlady, quickly putting down \nthe vinegar-cruet, so as to have one hand free ; ' look \nhere ; are you talking about prying open any of my \ndoors ? ' and with that she seized my arm. ' What 's \nthe matter with you ? What 's the matter with you, \nshipmate ? ' \n\nIn as calm, but rapid a manner as possible, I gave her \nto understand the whole case. Unconsciously clapping \nthe vinegar-cruet to one side of her nose, she ruminated \nfor an instant ; then exclaimed 4 No ! I haven't seen it \nsince I put it there.' Running to a little closet under the \nlanding of the stairs, she glanced in, and returning, told \nme that Queequeg's harpoon was missing. ' He 's killed \nhimself,' she cried. ' It 's unfort'nate Stiggs done over \nagain there goes another counterpane God pity his \npoor mother ! it will be the ruin of my house. Has \nthe poor lad a sister ? Where 's that girl ? there, Betty, \ngo to Snarles the Painter, and tell him to paint me a sign, \nwith \" no suicides permitted here, and no smoking in \nthe parlour \" ; might as well kill both birds at once. \nKill ? The Lord be merciful to his ghost ! What 's \nthat noise there ? You, young man, avast there ! ' \n\nAnd running after me, she caught me as I was again \ntrying to force open the door. \n\n' I won't allow it ; I won't have my premises spoiled. \nGo for the locksmith, there 's one about a mile from here. \nBut avast ! ' putting her hand in her side-pocket, ' here 's \n\n\n\nTHE RAMADAN 105 \n\na key that '11 fit, I guess ; let 's see.' And with that, she \nturned it in the lock ; but, alas ! Queequeg 's supple- \nmental bolt remained unwithdrawn within. \n\n6 Have to burst it open,' said I, and was running down \nthe entry a little, for a good start, when the landlady \ncaught at me, again vowing I should not break down her \npremises ; but I tore from her, and with a sudden bodily \nrush dashed myself full against the mark. \n\nWith a prodigious noise the door flew open, and the \nknob slamming against the wall, sent the plaster to the \nceiling ; and there, good heavens ! there sat Queequeg, \naltogether cool and self-collected ; right in the middle \nof the room ; squatting on his hams, and holding Yojo \non top of his head. He looked neither one way nor the \nother way, but sat like a carved image with scarce a sign \nof active life. \n\n' Queequeg/ said I, going up to him, ' Queequeg, what 's \nthe matter with you ? ' \n\n' He hain't been a-sittin* so all day, has he ? ' said the \nlandlady. \n\nBut all we said, not a word could we drag out of him ; \nI almost felt like pushing him over, so as to change his \nposition, for it was almost intolerable, it seemed so pain- \nfully and unnaturally constrained ; especially, as in all \nprobability he had been sitting so for upward of eight or \nten hours, going too without his regular meals. \n\n'Mrs. Hussey,' said I, 'he's alive, at all events; so \nleave us, if you please, and I will see to this strange affair \nmyself.' \n\nClosing the door upon the landlady, I endeavoured to \n\u003erevail upon Queequeg to take a chair ; but in vain. \nThere he sat ; and all he could do for all my polite \narts and blandishments he would not move a peg, nor \nsay a single word, nor even look at me, nor notice my \npresence in any the slightest way. \n\n\n\n106 MOBY-DICK \n\nI wonder, thought I, if this can possibly be a part of his \nRamadan ; do they fast on their hams that way in his \nnative island ? It must be so ; yes, it 's part of his \ncreed, I suppose ; well, then, let him rest ; he '11 get up \nsooner or later, no doubt. It can't last for ever, thank \nGod, and his Ramadan only comes once a year ; and I \ndon't believe it 's very punctual then. \n\nI went down to supper. After sitting a long time \nlistening to the long stories of some sailors who had just \ncome from a plum-pudding voyage, as they called it (that \nis, a short whaling voyage in a schooner or brig, confined \nto the north of the Line, in the Atlantic Ocean only) ; after \nlistening to these plum-puddingers till nearly eleven \no'clock, I went upstairs to go to bed, feeling quite sure \nby this time Queequeg must certainly have brought his \nRamadan to a termination. But no ; there he was just \nwhere I had left him ; he had not stirred an inch. I began \nto grow vexed with him ; it seemed so downright sense- \nless and insane to be sitting there all day and half the \nnight on his hams in a cold room, holding a piece of wood \non his head. \n\n' For heaven's sake, Queequeg, get up and shake your- \nself ; get up and have some supper. You 11 starve ; \nyou '11 kill yourself, Queequeg.' But not a word did he \nreply. \n\nDespairing of him, therefore, I deter mined to go to bed \nand to sleep ; and no doubt, before a great while, he \nwould follow me. But previous to turning in, I took my \nheavy bearskin jacket, and threw it over him, as it \npromised to be a very cold night ; and he had nothing \nbut his ordinary round jacket on. For some time, do \nall I would, I could not get into the faintest doze. I had \nblown out the candle ; and the mere thought of Queequeg \nnot four feet off sitting there in that uneasy position, \nstark alone in the cold and dark ; this made me really \n\n\n\nTHE RAMADAN 107 \n\nwretched. Think of it ; sleeping all night in the same \nroom with a wide-awake pagan on his hams in this dreary, \nunaccountable Ramadan ! \n\nBut somehow I dropped off at last, and knew nothing \nmore till break of day ; when, looking over the bedside, \nthere squatted Queequeg, as if he had been screwed down \nto the floor. But as soon as the first glimpse of sun \nentered the window, up he got, with stiff and grating \njoints, but with a cheerful look ; limped toward me where \nI lay ; pressed his forehead again against mine ; and said \nhis Ramadan was over. \n\nNow, as I before hinted, I have no objection to any \nperson's religion, be it what it may, so long as that person \ndoes not kill or insult any other person, because that other \nperson don't believe it also. But when a man's religion \nbecomes really frantic ; when it is a positive torment to \nhim ; and, in fine, makes this earth of ours an uncom- \nfortable inn to lodge in ; then I think it high time to take \nthat individual aside and argue the point with him. \n\nAnd just so I now did with Queequeg. ' Queequeg,' \nsaid I, ' get into bed now, and lie and listen to me.' I \nthen went on, beginning with the rise and progress of \nthe primitive religions, and coming down to the various \nreligions of the present time, during which time I laboured \nto show Queequeg that all these Lents, Ramadans, and \nprolonged ham-squattings in cold, cheerless rooms were \nstark nonsense ; bad for the health ; useless for the soul ; \nopposed, in short, to the obvious laws of hygiene and \ncommon-sense. I told him, too, that he being in other \nthings such an extremely sensible and sagacious savage, \nit pained me, very badly pained me, to see him now so \ndeplorably foolish about this ridiculous Ramadan of his. \nBesides, argued I, fasting makes the body cave in ; hence \nthe spirit caves in ; and all thoughts born of a fast must \nnecessarily be half -starved. This is the reason why most \n\n\n\n\n\n\n108 MOBY-DICK \n\ndyspeptic religionists cherish such melancholy notions \nabout their hereafters. In one word, Queequeg, said I, \nrather digressively ; hell is an idea first born on an un- \ndigested apple-dumpling ; and since then perpetuated \nthrough the hereditary dyspepsias nurtured by Bamadans. \n\nI then asked Queequeg whether he himself was ever \ntroubled with dyspepsia ; expressing the idea very plainly, \nso that he could take it in. He said no ; only upon one \nmemorable occasion. It was after a great feast given \nby his father the King, on the gaming of a great battle \nwherein fifty of the enemy had been killed by about two \no'clock in the afternoon, and all cooked and eaten that \nvery evening. \n\n4 No more, Queequeg,' said I, shuddering ; 'that will \ndo ' ; for I knew the inferences without his further hint- \ning them. I had seen a sailor who had visited that very \nisland, and he told me that it was the custom, when a \ngreat battle had been gained there, to barbecue all the \nslain in the yard or garden of the victor ; and then, one \nby one, they were placed in great wooden trenchers, and \ngarnished round like a pilau, with breadfruit and cocoa- \nnuts ; and with some parsley in their mouths, were sent \nround with the victor's compliments to all his friends, \njust as though these presents were so many Christmas \nturkeys. \n\nAfter all, I do not think that my remarks about religion \nmade much impression upon Queequeg. Because, in \nthe first place, he somehow seemed dull of hearing on \nthat important subject, unless considered from his own \npoint of view ; and, in the second place, he did not more \nthan one-third understand me, couch my ideas simply as \nI would ; and, finally, he no doubt thought he knew a \ngood deal more about the true religion than I did. He \nlooked at me with a sort of condescending concern and \ncompassion, as though he thought it a great pity that such \n\n\n\nTHE RAMADAN 109 \n\na sensible young man should be so hopelessly lost to \nevangelical pagan piety. \n\nAt last we rose and dressed ; and Queequeg, taking a \nprodigiously hearty breakfast of chowders of all sorts, so \nthat the landlady should not make much profit by reason \nof his Ramadan, we sallied out to board the Pequod, \nsauntering along, and picking our teeth with halibut \nbones. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII \n\nHIS MARK \n\nAs we were walking down the end of the wharf toward \nthe ship, Queequeg carrying his harpoon, Captain Peleg \nin his gruff voice loudly hailed us from his wigwam, saying \nhe had not suspected my friend was a cannibal, and \nfurthermore announcing that he let no cannibals on \nboard that craft, unless they previously produced their \npapers. \n\n' What do you mean by that, Captain Peleg ? ' said I, \nnow jumping on the bulwarks, and leaving my comrade \nstanding on the wharf. \n\n' I mean,' he replied, ' he must show his papers.' \n\n' Yea,' said Captain Bildad in his hollow voice, sticking \nhis head from behind Peleg 's, out of the wigwam. ' He \nmust show that he 's converted. Son of darkness/ he \nadded, turning to Queequeg, c art thou at present in \ncommunion with any Christian church ? ' \n\n' Why/ said I, ' he 's a member of the First Congrega- \ntional Church/ Here be it said, that many tattooed \nsavages sailing in Nantucket ships at last come to be \nconverted into the churches. \n\n' First Congregational Church/ cried Bildad, ' what ! \nthat worships in Deacon Deuteronomy Cole man's meeting- \nhouse ? ' and so saying, taking out his spectacles, he rubbed \nthem with his great yellow bandana handkerchief, and \nputting them on very carefully, came out of the wigwam, \nand leaning stiffly over the bulwarks, took a good long \nlook at Queequeg. \nIIP \n\n\n\nHIS MARK 111 \n\n* How long hath he been a member ? ' he then said, \nturning to me ; ' not very long, I rather guess, young \nman.' \n\n4 No/ said Peleg, ' and he hasn't been baptized right \neither, or it would have washed some of that devil's blue \noff his face.' \n\n' Do tell, now/ cried Bildad, ' is this Philistine a \nregular member of Deacon Deuteronomy's meeting ? \nI never saw him going there, and I pass it every Lord's \nday.' \n\n' I don't know anything about Deacon Deuteronomy \nor his meeting/ said I, ' all I know is, that Queequeg here \nis a born member of the First Congregational Church. \nHe is a deacon himself, Queequeg is.' \n\n' Young man/ said Bildad sternly, ' thou art skylarking \nwith me explain thyself, thou young Hittite. What \nchurch dost thee mean ? answer me.' \n\nFinding myself thus hard pushed, I replied, ' I mean, sir, \nthe same ancient Catholic Church to which you and I, \nand Captain Peleg there, and Queequeg here, and all of \nus, and every mother's son and soul of us belong ; the \ngreat and everlasting First Congregation of this whole \nworshipping world ; we all belong to that ; only some of \nus cherish some queer crotchets no ways touching the \ngrand belief ; in that we all join hands/ \n\n' Splice, thou mean'st splice hands/ cried Peleg, draw- \ning nearer. ' Young man, you 'd better ship for a mis- \nsionary, instead of a foremast hand ; I never heard a \nbetter sermon. Deacon Deuteronomy why Father \nMapple himself couldn't beat it, and he 's reckoned some- \nthing. Come aboard, come aboard ; never mind about \nthe papers. I say, tell Quohog there what 's that you \ncall him ? tell Quohog to step along. By the great \nanchor, what a harpoon he 's got there ! looks like good \nstuff that ; and he handles it about right. I say, Quohog, \n\n\n\n112 MOBY-DICK \n\nor whatever your name is, did you ever stand in the head \nof a whale-boat ? did you ever strike a fish ? ' \n\nWithout saying a word, Queequeg, in his wild sort of \nway, jumped upon the bulwarks, from thence into the \nbows of one of the whale-boats hanging to the side ; and \nthen bracing his left knee, and poising his harpoon, cried \nout in some such way as this : \n\n' Cap'ain, you see him small drop tar on water dere ? \nYou see him ? well, spose him one whale eye, well, den ! ' \nand taking sharp aim at it, he darted the iron right over \nold Bildad's broad brim, clean across the ship's decks, \nand struck the glistening tar spot out of sight/ \n\n' Now, 5 said Queequeg, quietly hauling in the line, \n* spos-ee him whale-e eye ; why, dad whale dead.' \n\n' Quick, Bildad,' said Peleg to his partner, who, aghast \nat the close vicinity of the flying harpoon, had retreated \ntoward the cabin gangway. ' Quick, I say, you, Bildad, \nand get the ship's papers. We must have Hedgehog \nthere, I mean Quohog, in one of our boats. Look ye, \nQuohog, we '11 give ye the ninetieth lay, and that 's \nmore than ever was given a harpooneer yet out of \nNantucket.' \n\nSo down we went into the cabin, and to my great joy \nQueequeg was soon enrolled among the same ship's \ncompany to which I myself belonged. \n\nWhen all preliminaries were over and Peleg had got \neverything ready for signing, he turned to me and said, \n' I guess, Quohog there don't know how to write, does he ? \nI say, Quohog, blast ye ! dost thou sign thy name or \nmake thy mark ? ' \n\nBut at this question, Queequeg, who had twice or \nthrice before taken part in similar ceremonies, looked \nno ways abashed ; but taking the offered pen, copied \nupon the paper, in the proper place, an exact counterpart \nof a queer round figure which was tattooed upon his arm ; \n\n\n\nHIS MARK 113 \n\nso that through Captain Peleg's obstinate mistake touch- \ning his appellative, it stood something like this : \n\nQuohog. \nhis \u003eJ\u003c mark. \n\nMeanwhile Captain Bildad sat earnestly and stead- \nfastly eyeing Queequeg, and at last rising solemnly and \nfumbling in the huge pockets of his broad-skirted drab \ncoat, took out a bundle of tracts, and selecting one entitled \n' The Latter Day Coming ; or No Time to Lose,' placed \nit in Queequeg 's hands, and then grasping them and the \nbook with both his, looked earnestly into his eyes, and \nsaid, ' Son of darkness, I must do my duty by thee ; I am \npart owner of this ship, and feel concerned for the souls of \nall its crew ; if thou still clingest to thy pagan ways, which \nI sadly fear, I beseech thee, remain not for aye a Belial \nbondsman. Spurn the idol Bell, and the hideous dragon ; \nturn from the wrath to come ; mind thine eye, I say ; oh ! \ngoodness gracious ! steer clear of the fiery pit ! ' \n\nSomething of the salt sea yet lingered in old Bildad's \nlanguage, heterogeneously mixed with Scriptural and \ndomestic phrases. \n\n' Avast there, avast there, Bildad, avast now spoiling \nour harpooneer,' cried Peleg. ' Pious harpooneers never \nmake good voyagers it takes the shark out of 'em ; no \nharpooneer is worth a straw who ain't pretty sharkish. \nThere was young Nat Swaine, once the bravest boat- \nheader out of all Nantucket and the Vineyard ; he joined \nthe meeting, and never came to good. He got so \nfrightened about his plaguy soul, that he shrinked and \nsheered away from whales, for fear of after-claps, in case \nhe got stove and went to Davy Jones.' \n\nc Peleg ! Peleg ! ' said Bildad, lifting his eyes and hands, \n'thou thyself, as I myself, hast seen many a perilous \ntime ; thou knowest, Peleg, what it is to have the fear of \n\nVOL. I. H \n\n\n\n114 MOBY-DICK \n\ndeath ; how, then, can'st thou prate in this ungodly guise. \nThou beliest thine own heart, Peleg. Tell me, when this \nsame Pequod here had her three masts overboard in that \ntyphoon on Japan, that same voyage when thou went \nmate with Captain Ahab, didst thou not think of Death \nand the Judgment then ? ' \n\n' Hear him, hear him now, ' cried Peleg, marching across \nthe cabin, and thrusting his hands far down into his \npockets, ' hear him, all of ye. Think of that ! When \nevery moment we thought the ship would sink ! Death \nand the Judgment then ? What ? With all three masts \nmaking such an everlasting thundering against the side ; \nand every sea breaking over us, fore and aft. Think of \nDeath and the Judgment then ? No ! no time to think \nabout Death then. Life was what Captain Ahab and I \nwas thinking of ; and how to save all hands how to rig \njury-masts how to get into the nearest port ; that was \nwhat I was thinking of. } \n\nBildad said no more, but buttoning up his coat, stalked \non deck, where we followed him. There he stood, very \nquietly overlooking some sail-makers who were mending \na topsail in the waist. Now and then he stooped to pick \nup a patch, or save an end of the tarred twine, which \notherwise might have been wasted. \n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX \n\nTHE PEOPHET \n\n' SHIPMATES, have ye shipped in that ship ? ' \n\nQueequeg and I had just left the Pequod, and were \nsauntering away from the water, for the moment each \noccupied with his own thoughts, when the above words \nwere put to us by a stranger, who, pausing before us, \nlevelled his massive forefinger at the vessel in question. \nHe was but shabbily apparelled in faded jacket and \npatched trowsers ; a rag of a black handkerchief investing \nhis neck. A confluent small-pox had in all directions \nflowed over his face, and left it like the complicated ribbed \nbed of a torrent, when the rushing waters have been \ndried up. \n\n4 Have ye shipped in her ? ' he repeated. \n\n4 You mean the ship Pequod, I suppose,' said I, trying \nto gain a little more time for an uninterrupted look at him. \n\n' Ay, the Pequod that ship there/ he said, drawing \nback his whole arm, and then rapidly shoving it straight \nout from him, with the fixed bayonet of his pointed \nfinger darted full at the object. \n\n' Yes,' said I, ' we have just signed the articles.' \n\n' Anything down there about your souls ? ' \n\n' About what ? ' \n\n' Oh, perhaps you hav'n't got any,' he said quickly. \nNo matter though, I know many chaps that hav'n't got \n\nly, good luck to 'em ; and they are all the better off for \nit. A soul 's a sort of a fifth wheel to a wagon.' \n\n' What are you jabbering about, shipmate ? ' said I. \n\n115 \n\n! \n\n\n\n116 MOBY-DICK \n\n' He 's got enough, though, to make up for all de- \nficiencies of that sort in other chaps,' abruptly said the \nstranger, placing a nervous emphasis upon the word he. \n\n' Queequeg,' said I, ' let 's go ; this fellow has broken \nloose from somewhere ; he 's talking about something \nand somebody we don't know.' \n\n' Stop ! ' cried the stranger. ' Ye said true ye \nhav'n't seen Old Thunder yet, have ye ? ' \n\n' Who 's Old Thunder ? ' said I, again riveted with the \ninsane earnestness of his manner. \n\n' Captain Ahab.' \n\n' What ! the captain of our ship, the Pequod ? ' \n\n' Ay, among some of us old sailor chaps, he goes by \nthat name. Ye hav'n't seen him yet, have ye ? ' \n\n' No, we hav'n't. He 's sick, they say, but is getting \nbetter, and will be all right again before long.' \n\n4 All right again before long ! ' laughed the stranger, \nwith a solemnly derisive sort of laugh. ' Look ye ; when \nCaptain Ahab is all right, then this left arm of mine will \nbe all right ; not before.' \n\ni What do you know about him ? ' \n\n' What did they tell you about him ? Say that ! ' \n\n' They didn't tell much of anything about him ; only \nI 've heard that he 's a good whale -hunter, and a good \ncaptain to his crew.' \n\n' That 's true, that 's true yes, both true enough. \nBut you must jump when he gives an order. Step and \ngrowl ; growl and go that 's the word with Captain \nAhab. But nothing about that thing that happened to \nhim off Cape Horn, long ago, when he lay like dead for \nthree days and nights ; nothing about that deadly scrim- \nmage with the Spaniard afore the altar in Santa ? heard \nnothing about that, eh ? Nothing about the silver cala- \nbash he spat into ? And nothing about his losing his \nleg last voyage, according to the prophecy. Didn't ye \n\n\n\nTHE PROPHET 117 \n\nhear a word about them matters and something more, eh ? \nNo, I don't think ye did ; how could ye ? Who knows \nit ? Not all Nantucket, I guess. But hows'ever, may- \nhap, ye Ve heard tell about the leg, and how he lost it ; \nay\u003e ye have heard of that, I dare say. Oh yes, that \nevery one knows a 'most I mean they know he 's only \none leg ; and that a parmacetti took the other off.' \n\n4 My friend/ said I, ' what all this gibberish of yours is \nabout, I don't know, and I don't much care ; for it seems \nto me that you must be a little damaged in the head. \nBut if you are speaking of Captain Ahab of that ship there, \nthe Pequod, then let me tell you, that I know all about \nthe loss of his leg.' \n\n' All about it, eh sure you do ? all ? ' \n\n* Pretty sure.' \n\nWith finger pointed and eye levelled at the Pequod, the \nbeggar-like stranger stood a moment, as if in a troubled \nre very ; then starting a little, turned and said, ' Ye Ve \nshipped, have ye ? Names down on the papers ? Well, \nwell, what 's signed, is signed ; and what 's to be, will be ; \nand then again, perhaps it won't be, after all. Anyhow, \nit's all fixed and arranged a 'ready ; and some sailors \nor other must go with him, I suppose ; as well these as \nany other men, God pity 'em ! Morning to ye, shipmates, \nmorning ; the ineffable heavens bless ye ; I 'm sorry I \nstopped ye.' \n\n' Look here, friend,' said I, 'if you have anything im- \nportant to tell us, out with it ; but if you are only trying \nto bamboozle us, you are mistaken in your game ; that 's \nall I have to say.' \n\n' And it 's said very well, and I like to hear a chap talk \nup that way ; you are just the man for him the likes of \nye. Morning to ye, shipmates, morning ! Oh ! when ye get \nthere, tell 'em I Ve concluded not to make one of 'em.' \n\n' Ah, my dear fellow, you can't fool us that way you \n\n\n\n118 MOBY-DICK \n\ncan't fool us. It is the easiest thing in the world for a man \nto look as if he had a great secret in him.' \n\n' Morning to ye, shipmates, morning.' \n\n' Morning it is,' said I. ' Come along, Queequeg, let 's \nleave this crazy man. But stop, tell me your name, will \nyou?' \n\n^Elijah/ \n\nElijah ! thought I, and we walked away, both comment- \ning, after each other's fashion, upon this ragged old sailor ; \nand agreed that he was nothing but a humbug, trying to \nbe a bugbear. But we had not gone perhaps above a \nhundred yards, when chancing to turn a corner, and look- \ning back as I did so, who should be seen but Elijah follow- \ning us, though at a distance. Somehow, the sight of him \nstruck me so, that I said nothing to Queequeg of his being \nbehind, but passed on with my comrade, anxious to see \nwhether the stranger would turn the same corner that we \ndid. He did ; and then it seemed to me that he was \ndogging us, but with what intent I could not for the life \nof me imagine. This circumstance, coupled with his \nambiguous, half-hinting, half-revealing, shrouded sort of \ntalk, now begat in me all kinds of vague wonderments \nand half -apprehensions, and all connected with the \nPequod ; and Captain Ahab ; and the leg he had lost ; \nand the Cape Horn fit ; and the silver calabash ; and what \nCaptain Peleg had said of him, when I left the ship the \nday previous ; and the prediction of the squaw Tistig ; \nand the voyage we had bound ourselves to sail ; and a \nhundred other shadowy things. \n\nI was resolved to satisfy myself whether this ragged Elijah \nwas really dogging us or not, and with that intent crossed \nthe way with Queequeg, and on that side of it retraced our \nsteps. But Elijah passed on, without seeming to notice \nus. This relieved me ; and once more, and finally as it \nseemed to me, I pronounced him in my heart, a humbug. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX \n\n\n\nALL ASTIR \n\nA DAY or two passed, and there was great activity aboard \nthe Pequod. Not only were the old sails being mended, \nbut new sails were coming on board, and bolts of canvas, \nand coils of rigging ; in short, everything betokened that \nthe ship's preparations were hurrying to a close. Captain \nPeleg seldom or never went ashore, but sat in his wigwam \nkeeping a sharp look-out upon the hands : Bildad did all \nthe purchasing and providing at the stores ; and the men \nemployed in the hold and on the rigging were working till \nlong after night-fall. \n\nOn the day following Queequeg's signing the articles, \nword was given at all the inns where the ship's company were \nstopping, that their chests must be on board before night, \nfor there was no telling how soon the vessel might be sailing. \nSo Queequeg and I got down our traps, resolving, how- \never, to sleep ashore till the last. But it seems they always \ngive very long notice in these cases, and the ship did not \nsail for several days. But no wonder ; there was a good \ndeal to be done, and there is no telling how many things \nto be thought of, before the Pequod was fully equipped. \n\nEveryone knows what a multitude of things beds, \nsaucepans, knives and forks, shovels and tongs, napkins, \nnut -crackers, and what not, are indispensable to the \nbusiness of housekeeping. Just so with whaling, which \nnecessitates a three -years' housekeeping upon the wide \nocean, far from all grocers, costermongers, doctors, bakers, \nand bankers . And though this also holds true of merchant \n\n\n\n120 MOBY-DICK \n\nvessels, yet not by any means to the same extent as with \nwhalemen. For besides the great length of the whaling \nvoyage, the numerous articles peculiar to the prosecution \nof the fishery, and the impossibility of replacing them at \nthe remote harbours usually frequented, it must be \nremembered, that of all ships, whaling-vessels are the most \nexposed to accidents of all kinds, and especially to the \ndestruction and loss of the very things upon which the \nsuccess of the voyage most depends. Hence, the spare \nboats, spare spars, and spare lines and harpoons, and spare \neverythings, almost, but a spare captain and duplicate \nship. \n\nAt the period of our arrival at the Island, the heaviest \nstorage of the Pequod had been almost completed ; com- \nprising her beef, bread, water, fuel, and iron hoops and \nstaves. But, as before hinted, for some time there was a \ncontinual fetching and carrying on board of divers odds \nand ends of things, both large and small. \n\nChief among those who did this fetching and carrying \nwas Captain Bildad's sister, a lean old lady of a most \ndetermined and indefatigable spirit, but withal very kind- \nhearted, who seemed resolved that, if she could help it, \nnothing should be found wanting in the Pequod, after \nonce fairly getting to sea. At one time she would come \non board with a jar of pickles for the steward's pantry ; \nanother time with a bunch of quills for the chief mate's \ndesk, where he kept his log ; a third time with a roll of \nflannel for the small of some one's rheumatic back. Never \ndid any woman better deserve her name, which was \nCharity Aunt Charity, as everybody called her. And \nlike a sister of charity did this charitable Aunt Charity \nbustle about hither and thither, ready to turn her hand \nand heart to anything that promised to yield safety, \ncomfort, and consolation to all on board a ship in which \nher beloved brother Bildad was concerned, and in \n\n\n\nALL ASTIR 121 \n\nwhich she herself owned a score or two of well-saved \ndollars. \n\nBut it was startling to see this excellent-hearted \nQuakeress coming on board, as she did the last day, with \na long oil-ladle in one hand, and a still longer whaling- \nlance in the other. Nor was Bildad himself nor Captain \nPeleg at all backward. As for Bildad, he carried about \nwith him a long list of the articles needed, and at every \nfresh arrival, down went his mark opposite that article \nupon the paper. Every once and a while Peleg came \nhobbling out of his whalebone den, roaring at the men \ndown the hatchways, roaring up to the riggers at the \nmast-head, and then concluded by roaring back into his \nwigwam. \n\nDuring these days of preparation, Queequeg and I often \nvisited the craft, and as often I asked about Captain \nAhab, and how he was, and when he was going to come on \nboard his ship. To these questions they would answer, \nthat he was getting better and better, and was expected \naboard every day ; meantime, the two captains, Peleg \nand Bildad, could attend to everything necessary to fit the \nvessel for the voyage. If I had been downright honest \nwith myself, I would have seen very plainly in my heart \nthat I did but half fancy being committed this way to \nso long a voyage, without once laying my eyes on the man \nwho was to be the absolute dictator of it, so soon as the \nship sailed out upon the open sea. But when a man \nsuspects any wrong, it sometimes happens that if he be \nalready involved in the matter, he insensibly strives to \ncover up his suspicions even from himself. And much \nthis way it was with me. I said nothing, and tried to \nthink nothing. \n\nAt last it was given out that some time next day the \nship would certainly sail. So next morning, Queequeg \nand I took a very early start. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI \n\nGOING ABOARD \n\nIT was nearly six o'clock, but only gray imperfect misty \ndawn, when we drew nigh the wharf. \n\n' There are some sailors running ahead there, if I see \nright/ said I to Queequeg, ' it can't be shadows ; she 's off \nby sunrise, I guess ; come on ! ' \n\n' Avast ! ' cried a voice, whose owner at the same time \ncoming close behind us, laid a hand upon both our \nshoulders, and then insinuating himself between us, stood \nstooping forward a little, in the uncertain twilight, \nstrangely peering from Queequeg to me. It was \nElijah. \n\nc Going aboard ? ' \n\n' Hands off, will you,' said I. \n\n' Lookee here,' said Queequeg, shaking himself, ' go \n'way ! ' \n\n' Ain't going aboard, then ? ' \n\n' Yes, we are,' said I, ' but what business is that of \nyours ? Do you know, Mr. Elijah, that I consider you a \nlittle impertinent ? ' \n\n' No, no, no ; I wasn't aware of that,' said Elijah, \nslowly and wonderingly looking from me to Queequeg, \nwith the most unaccountable glances. \n\n' Elijah,' said I, ' you will oblige my friend and me by \nwithdrawing. We are going to the Indian and Pacific \nOceans, and would prefer not to be detained.' \n\nc Ye be, be ye ? Coming back afore breakfast ? ' \n\n' He 's cracked, Queequeg,' said I ; ' come on.' \n122 \n\n\n\nGOING ABOARD 123 \n\n' Halloa ! ' cried stationary Elijah, hailing us when we \nhad removed a few paces. \n\n' Never mind him/ said I ; ' Queequeg, come on. 5 \n\nBut he stole up to us again, and suddenly clapping his \nhand on my shoulder, said, ' Did ye see anything looking \nlike men going toward that ship a while ago ? ' \n\nStruck by this plain matter-of-fact question, I answered, \nsaying, ' Yes, I thought I did see four or five men ; but it \nwas too dim to be sure.' \n\n' Very dim, very dim,' said Elijah. ' Morning to ye.' \n\nOnce more we quitted him ; but once more he came \nsoftly after us ; and touching my shoulder again, said, \n4 See if you can find 'em now, will ye ? ' \n\n' Find who ? ' \n\n* Morning to ye ! morning to ye ! ' he rejoined, again \nmoving off. ' Oh ! I was going to warn ye against \nbut never mind, never mind it 's all one, all in the \nfamily too ; sharp frost this morning, ain't it ? Good- \nbye to ye. Shan't see ye again very soon, I guess ; unless \nit 's before the Grand Jury.' And with these cracked \nwords he finally departed, leaving me, for the moment, in \nno small wonderment at his frantic impudence. \n\nAt last, stepping on board the Peqiiod, we found every- \nthing in profound quiet, not a soul moving. The cabin \nentrance was locked within ; the hatches were all on, and \nlumbered with coils of rigging. Going forward to the \nforecastle, we found the slide of the scuttle open. Seeing \na light, we went down, and found only an old rigger there, \nwrapped in a tattered pea-jacket. He was thrown at \nwhole length upon two chests, his face downward and \nenclosed in his folded arms. The profoundest slumber \nslept upon him. \n\n' Those sailors we saw, Queequeg, where can they have \ngone to ? ' said I, looking dubiously at the sleeper. But \nit seemed that, when on the wharf, Queequeg had not at \n\n\n\n124 MOBY-DICK \n\nall noticed what I now alluded to ; hence I would have \nthought myself to have been optically deceived in that \nmatter, were it not for Elijah's otherwise inexplicable \nquestion. But I beat the thing down ; and again mark- \ning the sleeper, jocularly hinted to Queequeg that perhaps \nwe had best sit up with the body ; telling him to estab- \nlish himself accordingly. He put his hand upon the \nsleeper's rear, as though feeling if it was soft enough ; and \nthen, without more ado, sat quietly down there. \n\n' Gracious ! Queequeg, don't sit there,' said I. \n\nc Oh ! perry dood seat,' said Queequeg, ' my country \nway ; won't hurt him face.' \n\n' Face ! ' said I, ' call that his face ? very benevolent \ncountenance then ; but how hard he breathes, he ? s \nheaving himself ; get off, Queequeg, you are heavy, it 's \ngrinding the face of the poor. Get off, Queequeg ! Look, \nhe '11 twitch you off soon. I wonder he don't wake.' \n\nQueequeg removed himself to just beyond the head of \nthe sleeper, and lighted his tomahawk-pipe. I sat at the \nfeet. We kept the pipe passing over the sleeper, from \none to the other. Meanwhile, upon questioning him in \nhis broken fashion, Queequeg gave me to understand \nthat, in his land, owing to the absence of settees and sofas \nof all sorts, the king, chiefs, and great people generally, \nwere in the custom of fattening some of the lower orders \nfor ottomans ; and to furnish a house comfortably in that \nrespect, you had only to buy up eight or ten lazy fellows, \nand lay them round in the piers and alcoves. Besides, \nit was very convenient on an excursion ; much better \nthan those garden-chairs which are convertible into \nwalking-sticks ; upon occasion, a chief calling his attend- \nant, and desiring him to make a settee of himself \nunder a spreading tree, perhaps in some damp marshy \nplace. \n\nWhile narrating these things, every time Queequeg \n\n\n\nGOING ABOARD 125 \n\nreceived the tomahawk from me, he flourished the hatchet - \nside of it over the sleeper's head. \n\n' What 's that for, Queequeg ? ' \n\n' Perry easy, kill-e ; oh ! perry easy ! ' \n\nHe was going on with some wild reminiscences about \nhis tomahawk-pipe, which, it seemed, had in its two uses \nboth brained his foes and soothed his soul, when we were \ndirectly attracted to the sleeping rigger. The strong \nvapour now completely filling the contracted hole, it began \nto tell upon him. He breathed with a sort of muffledness ; \nthen seemed troubled in the nose ; then revolved over \nonce or twice ; then sat up and rubbed his eyes. \n\n4 Halloa ! ' he breathed at last, ' who be ye smokers ? ' \n\n' Shipped men/ answered I. c When does she sail ? ' \n\n' Ay, ay, ye are going in her, be ye ? She sails to- \nday. The captain came aboard last night.' \n\n' What captain ? Ahab ? ' \n\n' Who but him indeed ? ' \n\nI was going to ask him some further questions concern- \ning Ahab, when we heard a noise on deck. \n\n' Halloa ! Starbuck 's astir,' said the rigger. ' He 's \na lively chief mate, that ; .good man, and a pious ; but \nall alive now, I must turn to.' And so saying he went on \ndeck, and we followed. \n\nIt was now clear sunrise. Soon the crew came on board \nin twos and threes ; the riggers bestirred themselves ; the \nmates were actively engaged ; and several of the shore \npeople were busy in bringing various last things on board. \nMeanwhile Captain Ahab remained invisibly enshrined \nwithin his cabin. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII \n\nMERRY CHRISTMAS \n\nAT length, toward noon, upon the final dismissal of the \nship's riggers, and after the Pequod had been hauled out \nfrom the wharf, and after the ever-thoughtful Charity \nhad come off in a whale-boat, with her last gift a night- \ncap for Stubb, the second mate, her brother-in-law, and \na spare Bible for the steward after all this, the two \ncaptains, Peleg and Bildad, issued from the cabin, and \nturning to the chief mate, Peleg said : \n\n' Now, Mr. Starbuck, are you sure everything is right ? \nCaptain Ahab is all ready just spoke to him nothing \nmore to be got from shore, eh ? Well, call all hands, \nthen. Muster 'em aft here blast 'em ! ' \n\n' No need of profane words, however great the hurry, \nPeleg,' said Bildad, ' but away with thee, friend Starbuck, \nand do our bidding.' \n\nHow now ! Here upon the very point of starting for \nthe voyage, Captain Peleg and Captain Bildad were going \nit with a high hand on the quarter-deck, just as if they \nwere to be joint-commanders at sea, as well as to all \nappearances in port. And, as for Captain Ahab, no sign \nof him was yet to be seen ; only, they said he was in the \ncabin. But then, the idea was, that his presence was by \nno means necessary in getting the ship under weigh, and \nsteering her well out to sea. Indeed, as that was not at \nall his proper business, but the pilot's ; and as he was not \nyet completely recovered so they said therefore, Cap- \ntain Ahab stayed below. And all this seemed natural \n\n126 \n\n\n\nMEKRY CHRISTMAS 127 \n\nenough ; especially as in the merchant service many \ncaptains never show themselves on deck for a consider- \nable time after heaving up the anchor, but remain over \nthe cabin table, having a farewell merry-making with \ntheir shore friends, before they quit the ship for good \nwith the pilot. \n\nBut there was not much chance to think over the \nmatter, for Captain Peleg was now all alive. He seemed to \ndo most of the talking and commanding, and not Bildad. \n\n' Aft here, ye sons of bachelors,' he cried, as the sailors \nlingered at the mainmast. ' Mr. Starbuck, drive 'em \naft.' \n\n' Strike the tent there ! ' was the next order. As I \nhinted before, this whalebone marquee was never pitched \nexcept in port ; and on board the Pequod, for thirty years, \nthe order to strike the tent was well known to be the next \nthing to heaving up the anchor. \n\n' Man the capstan ! Blood and thunder ! jump ! ' \nwas the next command, and the crew sprang for the \nhandspikes. \n\nNow, in getting under weigh, the station generally \noccupied by the pilot is the forward part of the ship. \nAnd here Bildad, who, with Peleg, be it known, in addi- \ntion to his other offices, was one of the licensed pilots of \nthe port he being suspected to have got himself made a \npilot in order to save the Nantucket pilot -fee to all the \nships he was concerned in, for he never piloted any other \ncraft Bildad, I say, might now be seen actively engaged \nin looking over the bows for the approaching anchor, \nand at intervals singing what seemed a dismal stave of \npsalmody, to cheer the hands at the windlass, who roared \nforth some sort of a chorus about the girls in Booble Alley, \nwith hearty goodwill. Nevertheless, not three days \nprevious, Bildad had told them that no profane songs \nwould be allowed on board the Pequod, particularly in \n\n\n\n\n128 MOBY-DICK \n\ngetting under weigh ; and Charity, his sister, had placed \na small choice copy of Watts in each seaman's berth. \n\nMeantime, overseeing the other part of the ship, Captain \nPeleg ripped and swore astern in the most frightful \nmanner. I almost thought he would sink the ship before \nthe anchor could be got up ; involuntarily I paused on my \nhandspike, and told Queequeg to do the same, thinking \nof the perils we both ran, in starting on the voyage with \nsuch a devil for a pilot. I was comforting myself, how- \never, with the thought that in pious Bildad might be \nfound some salvation, spite of his seven hundred and \nseventy-seventh lay ; when I felt a sudden sharp poke \nin my rear, and turning round, was horrified at the \napparition of Captain Peleg in the act of withdrawing \nhis leg from my immediate vicinity. That was my first \nkick. \n\n' Is that the way they heave in the marchant service ? ' \nhe roared. ' Spring, thou sheep-head ; spring, and break \nthy backbone ! Why don't ye spring, I say, all of ye \nspring ! Quohag ! spring, thou chap with the red \nwhiskers ; spring there, Scotch-cap ; spring, thou green \npants. Spring, I say, all of ye, and spring your eyes out ! ' \nAnd so saying, he moved along the windlass, here and \nthere using his leg very freely, while imperturbable Bildad \nkept leading off with his psalmody. Thinks I, Captain \nPeleg must have been drinking something to-day. \n\nAt last the anchor was up, the sails were set, and off \nwe glided. It was a short, cold Christmas ; and as the \nshort northern day merged into night, we found ourselves \nalmost broad upon the wintry ocean, whose freezing spray \ncased us in ice, as in polished armour. The long rows of \nteeth on the bulwarks glistened in the moonlight ; and \nlike the white ivory tusks of some huge elephant, vast \ncurving icicles depended from the bows. \n\nLank Bildad, as pilot, headed the first watch, and ever \n\n\n\nMERRY CHRISTMAS 129 \n\nand anon, as the old craft deep dived into the green seas, \nand sent the shivering frost all over her, and the winds \nhowled, and the cordage rang, his steady notes were \nheard, \n\n* Sweet fields beyond the swelling flood, \n\nStand dressed in living green. \n\nSo to the Jews old Canaan stood, \n\nWhile Jordan rolled between.' \n\nNever did those sweet words sound more sweetly to me \nthan then. They were full of hope and fruition. Spite \nof this frigid winter night in the boisterous Atlantic, \nspite of my wet feet and wetter jacket, there was yet, it \nthen seemed to me, many a pleasant haven in store ; and \nmeads and glades so eternally vernal, that the grass shot \nup by the spring, untrodden, unwilted, remains at \nmidsummer. \n\nAt last we gained such an offing, that the two pilots \nwere needed no longer. The stout sail-boat that had \naccompanied us began ranging alongside. \n\nIt was curious and not unpleasing, how Peleg and Bildad \nwere affected at this juncture, especially Captain Bildad. \nFor loath to depart, yet ; very loath to leave, for good, \na ship bound on so long and perilous a voyage beyond \nboth stormy Capes ; a ship in which some thousands of \nhis hard-earned dollars were invested ; a ship, in which \nan old shipmate sailed as captain ; a man almost as old \nas he, once more starting to encounter all the terrors of \nthe pitiless jaw ; loath to say good-bye to a thing so every \nway brimful of every interest to him, poor old Bildad \nlingered long ; paced the deck with anxious strides ; ran \ndown into the cabin to speak another farewell word there ; \nagain came on deck, and looked to windward ; looked \ntoward the wide and endless waters, only bounded by the \n* r-off unseen Eastern Continents ; looked toward the \n\nVOL. I. I \n\n\n\n130 MOBY-DICK \n\nland ; looked aloft ; looked right and left ; looked every- \nwhere and nowhere ; and at last, mechanically coiling \na rope upon its pin, convulsively grasped stout Peleg \nby the hand, and holding up a lantern, for a moment stood \ngazing heroically in his face, as much as to say, * Never- \ntheless, friend Peleg, I can stand it ; yes, I can.' \n\nAs for Peleg himself, he took it more like a philosopher ; \nbut for all his philosophy, there was a tear twinkling in \nhis eye, when the lantern came too near. And he, too, \ndid not a little run from cabin to deck now a word \nbelow, and now a word with Starbuck, the chief mate. \n\nBut, at last, he turned to his comrade, with a final sort \nof look about him, 4 Captain Bildad come, old ship- \nmate, we must go. Back the main-yard there ! Boat \nahoy ! Stand by to come close alongside, now ! Careful, \ncareful ! come, Bildad, boy say your last. Luck to ye, \nStarbuck luck to ye, Mr. Stubb luck to ye, Mr. Flask \ngood-bye, and good luck to ye all and this day three \nyears I '11 have a hot supper smoking for ye in old \nNantucket. Hurrah and away ! ' \n\n' God bless ye, and have ye in His holy keeping, men/ \nmurmured old Bildad, almost incoherently. ' I hope \nye '11 have fine weather now, so that Captain Ahab may \nsoon be moving among ye a pleasant sun is all he needs, \nand ye '11 have plenty of them in the tropic voyage ye go. \nBe careful in the hunt, ye mates. Don't stave the boats \nneedlessly, ye harpooneers ; good white cedar plank is \nraised full three per cent, within the year. Don't forget \nyour prayers, either. Mr. Starbuck, mind that cooper \ndon't waste the spare staves. Oh ! the sail-needles are \nin the green locker ! Don't whale it too much a Lord's \ndays, men ; but don't miss a fair chance either, that 's \nrejecting Heaven's good gifts. Have an eye to the \nmolasses tierce, Mr. Stubb ; it was a little leaky, I thought. \nIf ye touch at the islands, Mr. Flask, beware of fornica- \n\n\n\nMERRY CHRISTMAS 131 \n\ntion. Good-bye, good-bye ! Don't keep that cheese too \nlong down in the hold, Mr. Starbuck ; it '11 spoil. Be \ncareful with the butter twenty cents the pound it was, \nand mind ye, if \n\n' Come, come, Captain Bildad ; stop palavering, \naway ! ' and with that, Peleg hurried him over the side, \nand both dropped into the boat. \n\nShip and boat diverged ; the cold, damp night breeze \nblew between ; a screaming gull flew overhead ; the two \nhulls wildly rolled ; we gave three heavy-hearted cheers, \nand blindly plunged like fate into the lone Atlantic. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII \n\nTHE LEE SHORE \n\nSOME chapters back, one Bulkington was spoken of, a tall, \nnew-landed mariner, encountered in New Bedford at the \ninn. \n\nWhen on that shivering winter's night the Pequod \nthrust her vindictive bows into the cold malicious waves, \nwho should I see standing at her helm but Bulkington ! \nI looked with sympathetic awe and fearfulness upon the \nman, who in mid- winter just landed from a four years' \ndangerous voyage, could so unrestingly push off again \nfor still another tempestuous term. The land seemed \nscorching to his feet. Wonderfullest things are ever the \nunmentionable ; deep memories yield no epitaphs ; this \nsix-inch chapter is the stoneless grave of Bulkington. Let \nme only say that it fared with him as with the storm-tossed \nship, that miserably drives along the leeward land. The \nport would fain give succour ; the port is pitiful ; in the \nport is safety, comfort, hearthstone, supper, warm \nblankets, friends, all that 's kind to our mortalities. But \nin that gale, the port, the land, is that ship's direst \njeopardy ; she must fly all hospitality ; one touch of land, \nthough it but graze the keel, would make her shudder \nthrough and through. With all her might she crowds all \nsail off shore ; in so doing, fights 'gainst the very winds \nthat fain would blow her homeward ; seeks all the lashed \nsea's landlessness again ; for refuge's sake forlornly \nrushing into peril ; her only friend her bitterest foe ! \n\nKnow ye, now, Bulkington ? Glimpses do ye seem to \n\n132 \n\n\n\nTHE LEE SHORE 133 \n\nsee of that mortally intolerable truth ; that all deep, \nearnest thinking is but the intrepid effort of the soul to \nkeep the open independence of her sea ; while the wildest \nwinds of heaven and earth conspire to cast her on the \ntreacherous, slavish shore ? \n\nBut as in landlessness alone resides the highest truth, \nshoreless, indefinite as God so, better is it to perish in \nthat howling infinite, than be ingloriously dashed upon \nthe lee, even if that were safety ! For worm-like, then, \noh ! who would craven crawl to land ! Terrors of the \nterrible ! is all this agony so vain ? Take heart, take \nheart, Bulkington ! Bear thee grimly, demigod ! Up \nfrom the spray of thy ocean-perishing straight up, \nleaps thy apotheosis ! \n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV \n\nTHE ADVOCATE \n\nAs Queequeg and I are now fairly embarked in this busi- \nness of whaling ; and as this business of whaling has some- \nhow come to be regarded among landsmen as a rather \nunpoetical and disreputable pursuit ; therefore, I am all \nanxiety to convince ye, ye landsmen, of the injustice \nhereby done to us hunters of whales. \n\nIn the first place, it may be deemed almost superfluous \nto establish the fact, that among people at large, the \nbusiness of whaling is not accounted on a level with what \nare called the liberal professions. If a stranger were \nintroduced into any miscellaneous metropolitan society, \nit would but slightly advance the general opinion of his \nmerits, were he presented to the company as a harpooneer, \nsay ; and if in emulation of the naval officers he should \nappend the initials S.W.F. (Sperm Whale Fishery) to \nhis visiting card, such a procedure would be deemed pre- \neminently presuming and ridiculous. \n\nDoubtless one leading reason why the world declines \nhonouring us whalemen is this : they think that, at best, \nour vocation amounts to a butchering sort of business ; \nand that when actively engaged therein, we are surrounded \nby all manner of defilements. Butchers we are, that is \ntrue. But butchers, also, and butchers of the bloodiest \nbadge, have been all Martial Commanders whom the world \ninvariably delights to honour. And as for the matter of \nthe alleged uncleanliness of our business, ye shall soon \nbe initiated into certain facts hitherto pretty generally \n\n134 \n\n\n\nTHE ADVOCATE 185 \n\nunknown, and which, upon the whole, will triumphantly \nplant the sperm whale-ship at least among the cleanliest \nthings of this tidy earth. But even granting the charge \nin question to be true ; what disordered slippery decks \nof a whale-ship are comparable to the unspeakable carrion \nof those battlefields from which so many soldiers return \nto drink in all ladies' plaudits ? And if the idea of peril \nso much enhances the popular conceit of the soldier's \nprofession ; let me assure ye that many a veteran who \nhas freely marched up to a battery, would quickly recoil \nat the apparition of the sperm whale's vast tail, fanning \ninto eddies the air over his head. For what are the \ncomprehensible terrors of man compared with the inter- i \nlinked terrors and wonders of God ! \n\nBut, though the world scouts at us whale-hunters, yet \ndoes it unwittingly pay us the profoundest homage ; yea, \nan all-abounding adoration ! for almost all the tapers, \nlamps, and candles that burn round the globe, burn, \nas before so many shrines, to our glory ! \n\nBut look at this matter in other lights ; weigh it in all \nsorts of scales ; see what we whalemen are, and have been. \n\nWhy did the Dutch in De Witt's time have admirals \nof their whaling-fleets ? Why did Louis xvi. of France, \nat his own personal expense, fit out whaling-ships from \nDunkirk, and politely invite to that town some score or \ntwo of families from our own island of Nantucket ? Why \ndid Britain between the years 1750 and 1788 pay to her \nwhalemen in bounties upward of 1,000,000 ? And \nlastly, how comes it that we whalemen of America now\\ \noutnumber all the rest of the banded whalemen hi the \\ \nworld ; sail a navy of upward of seven hundred vessels ; \nmanned by eighteen thousand men ; yearly consuming \n4,000,000 of dollars ; the ships worth, at the time of \nsailing, $20,000,000 ; and every year importing into our \nharbours a well-reaped harvest of $7,000,000. How \n\n\n\n136 MOBY-DICK \n\ncomes all this, if there be not something puissant in \nwhaling ? \n\nBut this is not the half ; look again. \nI freely assert, that the cosmopolite philosopher cannot, \nfor his life, point out one single peaceful influence, which \nwithin the last sixty years has operated more potentially \nupon the whole broad world, taken in one aggregate, than \nthe high and mighty business of whaling. One way and \nanother, it has begotten events so remarkable in them- \nselves, and so continuously momentous in their sequential \nf issues, that whaling may well be regarded as that Egyptian \n/ mother, who bore offspring themselves pregnant from her \nwomb. It would be a hopeless, endless task to catalogue \nall these things. Let a handful suffice. For many years \n\\ past the whale-ship has been the pioneer in ferreting out \nthe remotest and least known parts of the earth. She has \nexplored seas and archipelagoes which had no chart, \nwhere no Cook or Vancouver had ever sailed. If Ameri- \ncan and European men-of-war now peacefully ride in once \nsavage harbours, let them fire salutes to the honour and \nthe glory of the whale-ship, which originally showed them \nthe way, and first interpreted between them and the \nsavages. They may celebrate as they will the heroes \nof exploring expeditions, your Cooks, your Krusen- \nsterns ; but I say that scores of anonymous captains \nhave sailed out of Nantucket, that were as great, and \ngreater than your Cook and your Krusenstern. For in \ntheir succourless empty-handedness, they, in the heathen- \nish sharked waters, and by the beaches of unrecorded, \njavelin islands, battled with virgin wonders and terrors \nthat Cook with all his marines and muskets would not \nwillingly have dared. All that is made such a flourish of \nin the old South Sea Voyages, those things were but the \nlifetime commonplaces of our heroic Nantucketers. \nOften, adventures which Vancouver dedicates three \n\n\n\nTHE ADVOCATE 137 \n\nchapters to, these men accounted unworthy of being set \ndown in the ship's common log. Ah, the world ! Oh, \nthe world ! \n\nUntil the whale-fishery rounded Cape Horn, no com- \nmerce but colonial, scarcely any intercourse but colonial, \nwas carried on between Europe and the long line of the \nopulent Spanish provinces on the Pacific coast. It was \nthe whaleman who first broke through the jealous policy \nof the Spanish crown, touching those colonies ; and, if \nspace permitted, it might be distinctly shown how from \nthose whalemen at last eventuated the liberation of Peru, \nChili, and Bolivia from the yoke of Old Spain, and the \nestablishment of the eternal democracy in those parts. \n\nThat great America on the other side of the sphere, \nAustralia, was given to the enlightened world by the \nwhaleman. After its first blunder-born discovery by a \nDutchman, all other ships long shunned those shores as \npestiferously barbarous ; but the whale -ship touched \nthere. The whale-ship is the true mother of that now \nmighty colony. Moreover, in the infancy of the first \nAustralian settlement, the emigrants were several times \nsaved from starvation by the benevolent biscuit of the \nwhale -ship luckily dropping an anchor in their waters. \nThe uncounted isles of all Polynesia confess the same \ntruth, and do commercial homage to the whale-ship, that \ncleared the way for the missionary and the merchant, and \nin many cases carried the primitive missionaries to their \nfirst destinations. If that double -bolted land, Japan, \nis ever to become hospitable, it is the whale-ship alone \nto whom the credit will be due ; for already she is on the \nthreshold. \n\nBut if, in the face of all this, you still declare that \nwhaling has no aesthetically noble associations connected \nwith it, then am I ready to shiver fifty lances with you \n\njre, and unhorse you with a split helmet every time. \n\n\n\n138 MOBY-DICK \n\nThe whale has no famous author, and whaling no \nfamous chronicler, you will say. \n\nThe whale no famous author, and whaling no famous \nchronicler ? Who wrote the first account of our levia- \nthan ? Who but mighty Job ! And who composed the \nfirst narrative of a whaling voyage ? Who, but no less \na prince than Alfred the Great, who, with his own royal \npen, took down the words from Other, the Norwegian \nwhale -hunter of those times ! And who pronounced our \nglowing eulogy in Parliament ? Who, but Edmund \nBurke ! \n\nTrue enough, but then whalemen themselves are poor \ndevils ; they have no good blood in their veins. \n\nNo good blood in their veins ? They have something \nbetter than royal blood there. The grandmother of \nBenjamin Franklin was Mary Morrel ; afterward, by \nmarriage, Mary Folger, one of the old settlers of Nantucket ? \nand the ancestress to a long line of Folgers and har- \npooneers all kith and kin to noble Benjamin this day \ndarting the barbed iron from one side of the world to \nthe other. \n\nGood again ; but then all confess that somehow whal- \ning is not respectable. \n\nWhaling not respectable ? Whaling is imperial ! By old \nEnglish statutory law, the whale is declared 'a royal fish.' l \n\nOh, that 's only nominal ! The whale himself has never \nfigured in any grand imposing way. \n\nThe whale never figured in any grand imposing way ? \nIn one of the mighty triumphs given to a Roman general \nupon his entering the world's capital, the bones of a whale, \nbrought all the way from the Syrian coast, were the most \nconspicuous object in the cymballed procession. 1 \n\nGrant it, since you cite it ; but, say what you will, \nthere is no real dignity in whaling. \n\n1 See subsequent chapters for something more on this head. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE ADVOCATE 139 \n\nNo dignity in whaling ? The dignity of our calling the \nvery heavens attest. Cetus is a constellation in the south ! \nNo more ! Drive down your hat in presence of the Czar, \nand take it off to Queequeg ! No more ! I know a man \nthat, in his lifetime, has taken three hundred and fifty \nwhales. I account that man more honourable than that \ngreat captain of antiquity who boasted of taking as many \nwalled towns. \n\nAnd, as for me, if, by any possibility, there be any as \nyet undiscovered prime thing in me ; if I shall ever \ndeserve any real repute in that small but high hushed \nworld which I might not be unreasonably ambitious of ; \nif hereafter I shall do anything that, upon the whole, \na man might rather have done than to have left undone ; \nif, at my death, my executors, or more properly my \ncreditors, find any precious MSS. in my desk, then here \nI prospectively ascribe all the honour and the glory to \nwhaling ; for a whale -ship was my Yale College and my \nHarvard. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV \n\nPOSTSCRIPT \n\nIN behalf of the dignity of whaling, I would fain advance \nnaught but substantiated facts. But after embattling his \nfacts, an advocate who should wholly suppress a not \nunreasonable surmise, which might tell eloquently upon his \ncause such an advocate, would he not be blameworthy ? \n\nIt is well known that at the coronation of kings and \nqueens, even modern ones, a certain curious process of \nseasoning them for their functions is gone through. There \nis a salt-cellar of state, so called, and there may be a castor \nof state. How they use the salt, precisely who knows ? \nCertain I am, however, that a king's head is solemnly \noiled at his coronation, even as a head of salad. Can it \nbe, though, that they anoint it with a view of making \nits interior run well, as they anoint machinery ? Much \nmight be ruminated here, concerning the essential dignity \nof this regal process, because in common life we esteem \nbut meanly and contemptibly a fellow who anoints his \nhair, and palpably smells of that anointing. In truth, a \nmature man who uses hair-oil, unless medicinally, that \nman has probably got a quoggy spot in him somewhere. \nAs a general rule, he can't amount to much in his totality. \n\nBut the only thing to be considered here, is this what \nkind of oil is used at coronations ? Certainly it cannot \nbe olive oil, nor macassar oil, nor castor oil, nor bear's oil, \nnor train oil, nor cod-liver oil. What then can it possibly \nbe, but sperm oil in its unmanufactured, unpolluted \nstate, the sweetest of all oils ? \n\nThink of that, ye loyal Britons ! we whalemen supply \nyour kings and queens with coronation stuff ! \n\n140 \n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVI \n\nKNIGHTS AND SQUIRES \n\nTHE chief mate of the Pequod was Starbuck, a native of \nNantucket, and a Quaker by descent. He was a long, \nearnest man, and though born on an icy coast, seemed \nwell adapted to endure hot latitudes, his flesh being hard \nas twice-baked biscuit. Transported to the Indies, his \nlive blood would not spoil like bottled ale. He must have \nbeen born in some time of general drought and famine, \nor upon one of those fast days for which his state is \nfamous. Only some thirty arid summers had he seen ; \nthose summers had dried up all his physical superfluous- \nness. But this, his thinness, so to speak, seemed no more \nthe token of wasting anxieties and cares, than it seemed \nthe indication of any bodily blight. It was merely the \ncondensation of the man. He was by no means ill-look- \ning ; quite the contrary. His pure tight skin was an \nexcellent fit ; and closely wrapped up in it, and embalmed \nwith inner health and strength, like a revivified Egyptian, \nthis Starbuck seemed prepared to endure for long ages \nto come, and to endure always, as now ; for be it Polar \nsnow or torrid sun, like a patent chronometer, his interior \nvitality was warranted to do well in all climates. Look- \ning into his eyes, you seemed to see there the yet lingering \nimages of those thousand-fold perils he had calmly con- \nfronted through life. A staid, steadfast man, whose life \nfor the most part was a telling pantomime of action, and \nnot a tame chapter of sounds. Yet, for all his hardy \n\u003ebriety and fortitude, there were certain qualities in \n\n141 \n\n\n\n142 MOBY-DICK \n\nhim which at times affected, and in some cases seemed well- \nnigh to overbalance all the rest. Uncommonly con- \nscientious for a seaman, and endued with a deep natural \nreverence, the wild watery loneliness of his life did there- \nfore strongly incline him to superstition ; but to that \nsort of superstition, which in some organisations seems \nrather to spring, somehow, from intelligence than from \nignorance. Outward portents and inward presentiments \nwere his. And if at times these things bent the welded \niron of his soul, much more did his far-away domestic \nmemories of his young Cape wife and child tend to bend \nhim still more from the original ruggedness of his nature, \nand open him still further to those latent influences which, \nin some honest-hearted men, restrain the gush of dare- \ndevil daring, so often evinced by others in the more \nperilous vicissitudes of the fishery. ' I will have no man \nin my boat/ said Starbuck, ' who is not afraid of a whale.' \nBy this, he seemed to mean, not only that the most \nreliable and useful courage was that which arises from the \nfair estimation of the encountered peril, but that an \nutterly fearless man is a far more dangerous comrade than \na coward. \n\n' Ay, ay/ said Stubb, the second mate, ' Starbuck, \nthere, is as careful a man as you '11 find anywhere in this \nfishery.' But we shall ere long see what that word \n' careful ' precisely means when used by a man like Stubb, \nor almost any other whale-hunter. \n\nStarbuck was no crusader after perils ; in him courage \nwas not a sentiment ; but a thing simply useful to him, \nand always at hand upon all mortally practical occasions. \nBesides, he thought, perhaps, that hi this business of \nwhaling, courage was one of the great staple outfits of the \nship, like her beef and her bread, and not to be foolishly \nwasted. Wherefore he had no fancy for lowering for \nwhales after sundown ; nor for persisting in fighting a \n\n\n\nKNIGHTS AND SQUIRES 143 \n\nfish that too much persisted in fighting him. For, thought \nStarbuck, I am here in this critical ocean to kill whales \nfor my living, and not to be killed by them for theirs ; \nand that hundreds of men had been so killed Starbuck \nwell knew. What doom was his own father's ? Where, \nin the bottomless deeps, could he find the torn limbs of \nhis brother ? \n\nWith memories like these in him, and, moreover, given \nto a certain superstitiousness, as has been said ; the \ncourage of this Starbuck which could, nevertheless, still \nflourish, must indeed have been extreme. But it was not \nin reasonable nature that a man so organised, and with \nsuch terrible experiences and remembrances as he had ; \nit was not in nature that these things should fail in latently \nengendering an element in him, which, under suitable \ncircumstances, would break out from its confinement, \nand burn all his courage up. And brave as he might be, \nit was that sort of bravery chiefly, visible in some intrepid \nmen, which, while generally abiding firm in the conflict \nwith seas, or winds, or whales, or any of the ordinary \nirrational horrors of the world, yet cannot withstand \nthose more terrific, because more spiritual terrors, which \nsometimes menace you from the concentrating brow of an \nenraged and mighty man. \n\nBut were the coming narrative to reveal, in any instance, \nthe complete abasement of poor Starbuck's fortitude, \nscarce might I have the heart to write it ; for it is a thing \nmost sorrowful, nay shocking, to expose the fall of valour \nin the soul. Men may seem detestable as joint-stock \ncompanies and nations ; knaves, fools, and murderers \nthere may be ; men may have mean and meagre aces ; \nbut man, hi the ideal, is so noble and so sparkling, such \na grand and glowing creature, that over any ignominious \nblemish in him all his fellows should run to throw their \ncostliest robes. That immaculate manliness we feel \n\n\n\n144 MOBY-DICK \n\nwithin ourselves, so far within us, that it remains intact \nthough all the outer character seem gone, bleeds with \nkeenest anguish at the undraped spectacle of a valour- \nruined man. Nor can piety itself, at such a shameful \nsight, completely stifle her upbraidings against the per- \nmitting stars. But this august dignity I treat of, is not \nthe dignity of kings and robes, but that abounding dignity \nwhich has no robed investiture. Thou shalt see it shining \nin the arm that wields a pick or drives a spike ; that \ndemocratic dignity which, on all hands, radiates without \nend from God ; Himself ! The great God absolute ! \nThe centre and circumference of all democracy ! His \nomnipresence, our divine equality ! \n\nIf, then, to meanest mariners, and renegades and casta- \nways, I shall hereafter ascribe high qualities, though dark ; \nweave round them tragic graces ; if even the most mourn- \nful, perchance the most abased, among them all, shall at \ntimes lift himself to the exalted mounts ; if I shall touch \nthat workman's arm with some ethereal light ; if I shall \nspread a rainbow over his disastrous set of sun ; then \nagainst all mortal critics bear me out in it, thou just \nSpirit of Equality, which hast spread one royal mantle \nof humanity over all my kind ! Bear me out in it, thou \ngreat democratic God ! who didst not refuse to the \nswart convict, Bunyan, the pale, poetic pearl ; Thou \nwho didst clothe with doubly hammered leaves of finest \ngold, the stumped and paupered arm of old Cervantes ; \nThou who didst pick up Andrew Jackson from the pebbles ; \nwho didst hurl him upon a war-horse ; who didst thunder \nhim higher than a throne ! Thou who, in all Thy mighty, \nearthly marchings, ever cullest Thy selectest champions \nfrom the kingly commons ; bear me out in it, God ! \n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVII \n\nKNIGHTS AND SQUIRES \n\nSTUBB was the second mate. He was a native of Cape \nCod ; and hence, according to local usage, was called a \nCape-Cod-man. A happy-go-lucky ; neither craven nor \nvaliant ; taking perils as they came with an indifferent \nair ; and while engaged in the most imminent crisis of \nthe chase, toiling away, calm and collected as a journey- \nman joiner engaged for the year. Good-humoured, easy, \nand careless, he presided over his whale-boat as if the \nmost deadly encounter were but a dinner, and his crew \nall invited guests. He was as particular about the com- \nfortable arrangement of his part of the boat, as an old \nstage-driver is about the snugness of his box. When close \nto the whale, in the very death-lock of the fight, he \nhandled his unpitying lance coolly and off-handedly, \nas a whistling tinker his hammer. He would hum over \nhis old rigadig tunes while flank and flank with the most \nexasperated monster. Long usage had, for this Stubb, \nconverted the jaws of death into an easy-chair. What \nhe thought of death itself, there is no telling. Whether \nhe ever thought of it at all, might be a question ; but, if \nhe ever did chance to cast his mind that way after a com- \nfortable dinner, no doubt, like a good sailor, he took it to \nbe a sort of call of the watch to tumble aloft, and bestir \nthemselves there, about something which he would find \nout when he obeyed the order, and not sooner. \n\nWhat, perhaps, with other things, made Stubb such an \neasy-going, unfearing man, so cheerily trudging off with \n\nVOL. i. K \n\n\n\n146 MOBY-DICK \n\nthe burden of life in a world full of grave peddlers, all \nbowed to the ground with their packs ; what helped to \nbring about that almost impious good-humour of his ; \nthat thing must have been his pipe. For, like his nose, \nhis short, black little pipe was one of the regular features \nof his face. You would almost as soon have expected \nhim to turn out of his bunk without his nose as without \nhis pipe. He kept a whole row of pipes there ready loaded, \nstuck in a rack, within easy reach of his hand ; and, \nwhenever he turned in, he smoked them all out in suc- \ncession, lighting one from the other to the end of the \nchapter ; then loading them again to be in readiness anew. \nFor, when Stubb dressed, instead of first putting his legs \ninto his trowsers, he put his pipe into his mouth. \n\nI say this continual smoking must have been one \ncause, at least, of his peculiar disposition ; for everyone \nknows that this earthly air, whether ashore or afloat, is \nterribly infected with the nameless miseries of the number- \nless mortals who have died exhaling it ; and as in time \nof the cholera, some people go about with a camphorated \nhandkerchief to their mouths ; so, likewise, against all \nmortal tribulations, Stubb 's tobacco smoke might have \noperated as a sort of disinfecting agent. \n\nThe third mate was Flask, a native of Tisbury, in \nMartha's Vineyard. A short, stout, ruddy young fellow, \nvery pugnacious concerning whales, who somehow seemed \nto think that the great leviathans had personally and \nhereditarily affronted him ; and therefore it was a sort \nof point of honour with him, to destroy them whenever \nencountered. So utterly lost was he to all sense of \nreverence for the many marvels of their majestic bulk \nand mystic ways ; and so dead to anything like an appre- \nhension of any possible danger from encountering them ; \nthat in his poor opinion, the wondrous whale was but a \nspecies of magnified mouse, or at least water-rat, requiring \n\n\n\nKNIGHTS AND SQUIRES 147 \n\nonly a little circumvention and some small application \nof time and trouble in order to kill and boil. This ignor- \nant, unconscious fearlessness of his made him a little \nwaggish in the matter of whales ; he followed these fish \nfor the fun of it ; and a three years' voyage round Cape \nHorn was only a jolly joke that lasted that length of time. \nAs a carpenter's nails are divided into wrought nails and \ncut nails ; so mankind may be similarly divided. Little \nFlask was one of the wrought ones ; made to clinch tight \nand last long. They called him King-Post on board of the \nPequod ; because, in form, he could be well likened to the \nshort, square timber known by that name in Arctic \nwhalers ; and which by the means of many radiating \nside timbers inserted into it, served to brace the ship \nagainst the icy concussions of those battering seas. \n\nNow these three mates Starbuck, Stubb, and Flask \nwere momentous men. They it was who by universal \nprescription commanded three of the Pequod' \u0026 boats as | \nheadsmen. In that grand order of battle in which Gap- \ntain Ahab would probably marshal his forces to descend \non the whales, these three headsmen were as captains \nof companies. Or, being armed with their long keen \nwhaling-spears, they were as a picked trio of lancers ; \neven as the harpooneers were flingers of javelins. \n\nAnd since in this famous fishery, each mate or heads- \nman, like a Gothic knight of old, is always accompanied \nby his boat-steerer or harpooneer, who in certain con- \njunctures provides him with a fresh lance, when the former \none has been badly twisted, or elbowed in the assault ; \nand moreover, as there generally subsists between the \ntwo a close intimacy and friendliness ; it is therefore \nbut meet, that in this place we set down who the Pequod 's \nharpooneers were, and to what headsman each of them \nbelonged. \n\nFirst of all was Queequeg, whom Starbuck, the chief \n\n\n\n148 MOBY-DICK \n\nmate, had selected for his squire. But Queequeg is \nalready known. \n\nNext was Tashtego, an unmixed Indian from Gay \nHead, the most westerly promontory of Martha's Vine- \nyard, where there still exists the last remnant of a village \nof red men, which has long supplied the neighbouring \nisland of Nantucket with many of her most daring har- \npooneers. In the fishery, they usually go by the generic \nname of Gay-Headers. Tashtego 's long, lean, sable hair, \nhis high cheek-bones, and black rounding eyes for an \nIndian, Oriental in their largeness, but Antarctic in their \nglittering expression all this sufficiently proclaimed him \nan inheritor of the unvitiated blood of those proud warrior \nhunters, who, in quest of the great New England moose, \nhad scoured, bow in hand, the aboriginal forests of the \nmain. But no longer snuffing in the trail of the wild \nbeasts of the woodland, Tashtego now hunted in the wake \nof the great whales of the sea ; the unerring harpoon of \nthe son fitly replacing the infallible arrow of the sires. \nTo look at the tawny brawn of his lithe snaky limbs, you \nwould almost have credited the superstitions of some of \nthe earlier Puritans, and half-believed this wild Indian \nto be a son of the Prince of the Powers of the Air. Tash- \ntego was Stubb the second mate's squire. \n\nThird among the harpooneers was Daggoo, a gigantic, \ncoal - black negro-savage, with a lion -like tread an \nAhasuerus to behold. Suspended from his ears were \ntwo golden hoops, so large that the sailors called them \nring-bolts, and would talk of securing the topsail halyards \nto them. In his youth Daggoo had voluntarily shipped \non board of a whaler, lying in a lonely bay on his native \ncoast. And never having been anywhere in the world \nbut in Africa, Nantucket, and the pagan harbours most \nfrequented by whalemen ; and having now led for many \nyears the bold life of the fishery in the ships of owners un- \n\n\n\nI \n\n\n\nKNIGHTS AND SQUIRES 149 \n\ncommonly heedful of what manner of men they shipped ; \nDaggoo retained all his barbaric virtues, and erect as a \ngiraffe, moved about the decks in all the pomp of six feet \nfive in his socks. There was a corporeal humility in \nlooking up at him ; and a white man standing before him \nseemed a white flag come to beg truce of a fortress. \nCurious to tell, this imperial negro, Ahasuerus Daggoo, \nwas the squire of little Flask, who looked like a chess-man \nbeside him. As for the residue of the Pequod'B company, \nbe it said, that at the present day not one in two of the \nmany thousand men before the mast employed in the \nAmerican whale-fishery are Americans born, though pretty \nnearly all the officers are. Herein it is the same with \nthe American whale-fishery as with the American army \nand military and merchant navies, and the engineering \nforces employed in the construction of the American \ncanals and railroads. The same, I say, because in all \nthese cases the native American liberally provides the \nbrains, the rest of the world as generously supplying the \nmuscles. No small number of these whaling seamen \nbelong to the Azores, where the outward-bound Nan- \ntucket whalers frequently touch to augment their crews \nfrom the hardy peasants of those rocky shores. In like \nmanner, the Greenland whalers sailing out of Hull or \nLondon put in at the Shetland Islands, to receive the \nfull complement of their crew. Upon the passage home- \nward, they drop them there again. How it is, there is \nno telling, but Islanders seem to make the best whalemen. \nThey were nearly all Islanders in the Pequod, ' Isolatoes ' \ntoo, I call such, not acknowledging the common continent \nof men, but each Isolate living on a separate continent \nof his own. Yet now, federated along one keel, what a \nset these Isolatoes were ! An Anacharsis Clootz deputa- \ntion from all the isles of the sea, and all the ends of the \nearth, accompanying Old Ahab in the Pequod to lay the \n\n\n\n150 MOBY-DICK \n\nworld's grievances before that bar from which not very \nmany of them ever come back. Black Little Pip he \nnever did oh, no ! he went before. Poor Alabama boy ! \nOn the grim Pequod's forecastle, ye shall ere long see him, \nbeating his tambourine ; prelusive of the eternal time, \nwhen sent for, to the great quarter-deck on high, he was \nbid strike in with angels, and beat his tambourine in \nglory ; called a coward here, hailed a hero there ! \n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVIII \n\nAHAB \n\nFOB several days after leaving Nantucket, nothing above \nhatches was seen of Captain Ahab. The mates regularly \nrelieved each other at the watches, and for aught that \ncould be seen to the contrary, they seemed to be the only \ncommanders of the ship ; only they sometimes issued from \nthe cabin with orders so sudden and peremptory, that \nafter all it was plain they but commanded vicariously. \nYes, their supreme lord and dictator was there, though \nhitherto unseen by any eyes not permitted to penetrate \ninto the now sacred retreat of the cabin. \n\nEvery time I ascended to the deck from my watches \nbelow, I instantly gazed aft to mark if any strange face \nwere visible ; for my first vague disquietude touching \nthe unknown captain, now in the seclusion of the sea, \nbecame almost a perturbation. This was strangely \nheightened at times by the ragged Elijah's diabolical \nincoherences uninvitingly recurring to me, with a subtle \nenergy I could not have before conceived of. But poorly \ncould I withstand them, much as in other moods I was \nalmost ready to smile at the solemn whimsicalities of that \noutlandish prophet of the wharves. But whatever it was \nof apprehensiveness or uneasiness to call it so which I \nfelt, yet whenever I came to look about me in the ship, \nit seemed against all warranty to cherish such emotions. \nFor though the harpooneers, with the great body of the \ncrew, were a far more barbaric, heathenish, and motley \nset than any of the tame merchant-ship companies which \n\n151 \n\n\n\n152 MOBY-DICK \n\nmy previous experiences had made me acquainted with, \nstill I ascribed this and rightly ascribed it to the fierce \nuniqueness of the very nature of that wild Scandinavian \nvocation in which I had so abandonedly embarked. But \nit was especially the aspect of the three chief officers of \nthe ship, the mates, which was most forcibly calculated \nto allay these colourless misgivings, and induce confidence \nand cheerfulness in every presentment of the voyage. \nThree better, more likely sea-officers and men, each in \nhis own different way, could not readily be found, and \nthey were every one of them Americans ; a Nantucketer, \na Vineyarder, a Cape man. Now, it being Christmas \nwhen the ship shot from out her harbour, for a space we \nhad biting Polar weather, though all the time running \naway from it to the southward ; and by every degree \nand minute of latitude which we sailed, gradually leaving \nthat merciless winter, and all its intolerable weather \nbehind us. It was one of those less lowering, but still \ngray and gloomy enough mornings of the transition, when \nwith a fair wind the ship was rushing through the water \nwith a vindictive sort of leaping and melancholy rapidity, \nthat as I mounted to the deck at the call of the forenoon \nwatch, so soon as I levelled my glance toward the tanrail, \nforeboding shivers ran over me. Reality outran appre- \nhension ; .Captain Ahab stood upon his quarter-deck. \n\nThere seemed no sign of common bodily illness about \nhim, nor of the recovery from any. He looked like a man \ncut away from the stake, when the fire has overrunningly \nwasted all the limbs without consuming them, or taking \naway one particle from their compacted aged robustness. \nHis whole high, broad form, seemed made of solid bronze, \nand shaped in an unalterable mould, like Cellini's cast \nPerseus. Threading its way out from among his gray \nhairs, and continuing right down one side of his tawny \nscorched face and neck, till it disappeared in his clothing, \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAHAB 153 \n\nyou saw a slender rod-like mark, lividly whitish. It \nresembled that perpendicular seam sometimes made in \nthe straight, lofty trunk of a great tree, when the upper \nlightning tearingly darts down it, and without wrenching \na single twig, peels and grooves out the bark from top to \nbottom, ere running off into the soil, leaving the tree still \ngreenly alive, but branded. Whether that mark was born \nwith him, or whether it was the scar left by some desperate \nwound, no one could certainly say. By some tacit con- \nsent, throughout the voyage little or no allusion was made \nto it, especially by the mates. But once Tashtego's \nsenior, an old Gay-Head Indian among the crew, super- \nstitiously asserted that not till he was full forty years \nold did Ahab become that way branded, and then it \ncame upon him, not in the fury of any mortal fray, but \nin an elemental strife at sea. Yet, this wild hint seemed \ninferentially negatived by what a gray Manxman in- \nsinuated, an old sepulchral man, who, having never \nbefore sailed out of Nantucket, had never ere this laid eye \nupon wild Ahab. Nevertheless, the old sea-traditions, \nthe immemorial credulities, popularly invested this old \nManxman with preternatural powers of discernment. \nSo that no white sailor seriously contradicted him when \nhe said that if ever Captain Ahab should be tranquilly \nlaid out which might hardly come to pass, so he muttered \nthen, whoever should do that last office for the dead \nwould find a birth-mark on him from crown to sole. \n\nSo powerfully did the whole grim aspect of Ahab affect \nme, and the livid brand which streaked it, that for the \nfirst few moments I hardly noted that not a little of this \noverbearing grimness was owing to the barbaric white \nleg upon which he partly stood. It had previously come \nto me that this ivory leg had at sea been fashioned from \nthe polished bone of the sperm whale's jaw. * Ay, he \nwas dismasted off Japan,' said the old Gay-Head Indian \n\n\n\n154 MOBY-DICK \n\nonce ; ' but like his dismasted craft, he shipped another \nmast without coming home for it. He has a quiver of 'em.' \n\nI was struck with the singular posture he maintained. \nUpon each side of the Pequod's quarter-deck, and pretty \nclose to the mizen shrouds, there was an auger-hole, \nbored about half an inch or so, into the plank. His bone \nleg steadied in that hole ; one arm elevated, and holding \nby a shroud ; Captain Ahab stood erect, looking straight \nout beyond the ship's ever-pitching prow. There was an \ninfinity of firmest fortitude, a determinate, unsurrender- \nable wilfulness, in the fixed and fearless, forward dedi- \ncation of that glance. Not a word he spoke ; nor did \nhis officers say aught to him ; though by all their minutest \ngestures and expressions, they plainly showed the uneasy, \nif not painful, consciousness of being under a troubled \nmaster-eye. And not only that, but moody stricken \nAhab stood before them with a crucifixion in his face ; \nin all the nameless regal overbearing dignity of some \nmighty woe. \n\nEre long, from his first visit in the air, he withdrew into \nhis cabin. But after that morning, he was every day \nvisible to the crew ; either standing in his pivot -hole, \nor seated upon an ivory stool he had ; or heavily walking \nthe deck. As the sky grew less gloomy ; indeed, began \nto grow a little genial, he became still less and less a recluse ; \nas if, when the ship had sailed from home, nothing but \nthe dead wintry bleakness of the sea had then kept him \nso secluded. And, by and by, it came to pass, that he \nwas almost continually in the air ; but, as yet, for all that \nhe said, or perceptibly did, on the at last sunny deck, he \nseemed as unnecessary there as another mast. But the \nPequod was only making a passage now ; not regularly \ncruising ; nearly all whaling preparatives needing super- \nvision the mates were fully competent to, so that there \nwas little or nothing, out of himself, to employ or excite \n\n\n\nAHAB 155 \n\nAhab now ; and thus chase away, for that one interval, \nthe clouds that layer upon layer were piled upon his \nbrow, as ever all clouds choose the loftiest peaks to pile \nthemselves upon. \n\nNevertheless, ere long, the warm, warbling persuasive- \nness of the pleasant, holiday weather we came to, seemed \ngradually to charm him from his mood. For, as when the \nred-cheeked, dancing girls, April and May, trip home to \nthe wintry, misanthropic woods ; even the barest, \nruggedest, most thunder-cloven old oak will at least send \nforth some few green sprouts, to welcome such glad- \nhearted visitants ; so Ahab did, in the end, a little \nrespond to the playful allurings of that girlish air. More \nthan once did he put forth the faint blossom of a look, \nwhich, in any other man, would have soon flowered out \nin a smile. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIX \n\nTO HIM, STUBB \n\nSOME days elapsed, and ice and icebergs all astern, the \nPequod now went rolling through the bright Quito spring, \nwhich, at sea, almost perpetually reigns on the threshold \nof the eternal August of the Tropic. The warmly cool, \nclear, ringing, perfumed, overflowing, redundant days, \nwere as crystal goblets of Persian sherbet, heaped up \nflaked up, with rose-water snow. The starred and stately \nnights seemed haughty dames in jewelled velvets, nursing \nat home in lonely pride, the memory of their absent \nconquering Earls, the golden helmeted suns ! For \nsleeping man, 'twas hard to choose between such winsome \ndays and such seducing nights. But all the witcheries \nof that unwaning weather did not merely lend new spells \nand potencies to the outward world. Inward they \nturned upon the soul, especially when the still mild hours \nof eve came on ; then, memory shot her crystals as the \nclear ice most forms of noiseless twilights. And all these \nsubtle agencies, more and more they wrought on Ahab's \ntexture. \n\nOld age is always wakeful ; as if, the longer linked with \nlife, the less man has to do with aught that looks like \ndeath. Among sea-commanders, the old graybeards will \noftenest leave their berths to visit the night-cloaked deck. \nIt was so with Ahab ; only that now, of late, he seemed \nso much to live in the open air, that truly speaking, his \nvisits were more to the cabin, than from the cabin to the \nplanks. ' It feels like going down into one's tomb,' \n\n156 \n\n\n\nENTER AHAB 157 \n\nhe would mutter to himself, ' for an old captain like me \nto be descending this narrow scuttle, to go to my grave- \ndug berth/ \n\nSo, almost every twenty-four hours, when the watches \nof the night were set, and the band on deck sentinelled \nthe slumbers of the band below ; and when if a rope was \nto be hauled upon the forecastle, the sailors flung it not \nrudely down, as by day, but with some cautiousness \ndropped it to its place, for fear of disturbing their slumber- \ning shipmates ; when this sort of steady quietude would \nbegin to prevail, habitually, the silent steersman would \nwatch the cabin-scuttle ; and ere long the old man would \nemerge, gripping at the iron banister, to help his crippled \nway. Some considerating touch of humanity was in \nhim ; for at times like these, he usually abstained from \npatrolling the quarter-deck ; because to his wearied \nmates, seeking repose within six inches of his ivory heel, \nsuch would have been the reverberating crack and din \nof that bony step, that their dreams would have been of \nthe crunching teeth of sharks. But once, the mood was \non him too deep for common regardings ; and as with \nheavy, lumber-like pace he was measuring the ship from \ntanrail to mainmast, Stubb, the odd second mate, came \nup from below, and with a certain unassured, deprecating \nhumorousness, hinted that if Captain Ahab was pleased \nto walk the planks, then, no one could say nay ; but \nthere might be some way of muffling the noise ; hinting \nsomething indistinctly and hesitatingly about a globe \nof tow, and the insertion into it, of the ivory heel. Ah ! \nStubb, thou didst not know Ahab then. \n\n' Am I a cannon-ball, Stubb/ said Ahab, ' that thou \nwouldst wad me that fashion ? But go thy ways ; I had \nforgot. Below to thy nightly grave ; where such as ye \nsleep between shrouds, to use ye to the filling one at last. \nDown, dog, and kennel ! ' \n\n\n\n158 MOBY-DICK \n\n{Starting at the unforeseen concluding exclamation of \nthe so suddenly scornful old man, Stubb was speechless \na moment ; then said excitedly, ' I am not used to be \nspoken to that way, sir ; I do but less than half like it, \nsir.' \n\n' Avast ! ' gritted Ahab between his set teeth, and \nviolently moving away, as if to avoid some passionate \ntemptation. \n\n' No, sir ; not yet,' said Stubb, emboldened. ' I will \nnot tamely be called a dog, sir.' \n\n' Then be called ten times a donkey, and a mule, and \nan ass, and begone, or I 11 clear the world of thee ! ' \n\nAs he said this, Ahab advanced upon him with such \noverbearing terrors in his aspect, that Stubb involuntarily \nretreated. \n\n' I was never served so before without giving a hard blow \nfor it,' muttered Stubb, as he found himself descending \nthe cabin-scuttle. ' It 's very queer. Stop, Stubb ; \nsomehow, now, I don't well know whether to go back and \nstrike him, or what 's that ? down here on my knees \nand pray for him ? Yes, that was the thought coming \nup in me ; but it would be the first time I ever did pray. \nIt 's queer ; very queer ; and he 's queer too ; ay, take \nhim fore and aft, he 's about the queerest old man Stubb \never sailed with. How he flashed at me ! his eyes like \npowder-pans ! is he mad ? Anyway there 's something \non his mind, as sure as there must be something on a deck \nwhen it cracks. He ain't in his bed now, either, more \nthan three hours out of the twenty-four ; and he don't \nsleep then. Didn't that Dough-Boy, the steward, tell \nme that of a morning he always finds the old man's ham- \nmock clothes all rumpled and tumbled, and the sheets \ndown at the foot, and the coverlid almost tied into knots, \nand the pillow a sort of frightful hot, as though a baked \nbrick had been on it ? A hot old man ! I guess he 's \n\n\n\nENTER AHAB 159 \n\ngot what some folks ashore call a conscience ; it 's a kind \nof Tic-Dolly-row they say worse nor a toothache. Well, \nwell ; I don't know what it is, but the Lord keep me from \ncatching it. He 's full of riddles ; I wonder what he goes \ninto the after-hold for, every night, as Dough -Boy tells me \nhe suspects ; what 's that for, I should like to know ? \nWho 's made appointments with him in the hold ? Ain't \nthat queer, now ? But there 's no telling, it 's the old \ngame. Here goes for a snooze. Damn me, it 's worth a \nfellow's while to be born into the world, if only to fall right \nasleep. And now that I think of it, that 's about the first \nthing babies do, and that 's a sort of queer, too. Damn \nme, but all things are queer, come to think of 'em. But \nthat 's against my principles. Think not, is my eleventh, \ncommandment ; and sleep when you can, is my twelfth. \n\"feo here goes again. But how 's that ? didn't he call me \na dog ? blazes ! he called me ten times a donkey, and \npiled a lot of jackasses on top of that \\ He might as well \nhave kicked me, and done with it. Maybe he did kick me, \nand I didn't observe it, I was so taken all aback with his \nbrow, somehow. It flashed like a bleached bone. What \nthe devil 's the matter with me ? I don't stand right \non my legs. Coming afoul of that old man has a sort of \nturned me wrong side out. By the Lord, I must have \nbeen dreaming, though How 1 how ? how ? but the \nonly way 's to stash it ; so here goes to hammock again ; \nand in the morning, I '11 see how this plaguy juggling \nthinks over by daylight.' \n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXX \n\nTHE PIPE \n\nWHEN Stubb had departed, Ahab stood for a while leaning \nover the bulwarks ; and then, as had been usual with him \nof late, calling a sailor of the watch, he sent him below for \nhis ivory stool, and also his pipe. Lighting the pipe at \nthe binnacle lamp and planting the stool on the weather- \nside of the deck, he sat and smoked. \n\nIn old Norse times, the thrones of the sea-loving Danish \nkings were fabricated, saith tradition, of the tusks of the \nnarwhale. How could one look at Ahab then, seated on \nthat tripod of bones, without bethinking him of the \nroyalty it symbolised ? For a khan of the plank, and \na king of the sea, and a great lord of leviathans was Ahab. \n\nSome moments passed, during which the thick vapour \ncame from his mouth in quick and constant puffs, which \nblew back again into his face. ' How now, ' he soliloquised \nat last, withdrawing the tube, 'this smoking no longer \nsoothes. Oh, my pipe ! hard must it go with me if thy \ncharm be gone ! Here have I been unconsciously toiling, \nnot pleasuring, ay, and ignorantly smoking to windward \nall the while ; to windward, and with such nervous whiffs, \nas if, like the dying whale, my final jets were the strongest \nand fullest of trouble. What business have I with this \npipe ? This thing that is meant for sereneness, to send up \nmild white vapours among mild white hairs, not among \ntorn iron -gray locks like mine. I '11 smoke no more \n\nHe tossed the still lighted pipe into the sea. The fire \nhissed in the waves ; the same instant the ship shot by \nthe bubble the sinking pipe made. With slouched hat, \nAhab lurchingly paced the planks. \n\n160 \n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXI \n\nQUEEN MAB \n\nNEXT morning Stubb accosted Flask. \n\n' Such a queer dream, King-Post, I never had. You \nknow the old man's ivory leg, well I dreamed he kicked \nme with it ; and when I tried to kick back, upon my soul, \nmy little man, I kicked my leg right off ! And then, \npresto ! Ahab seemed a pyramid, and I, like a blazing \nfool, kept kicking at it. But what was still more curious, \nFlask you know how curious all dreams are through \nall this rage that I was in, I somehow seemed to be think- \ning to myself, that after all, it was not much of an insult, \nthat kick from Ahab. \" Why,\" thinks I, \" what 's the \nrow ? It 's not a real leg, only a false leg.\" And there 's \na mighty difference between a living thump and a dead \nthump. That 's what makes a blow from the hand, \nFlask, fifty times more savage to bear than a blow from \na cane. The living member that makes the living insult, \nmy little man. And thinks I to myself afl the wnile, \nmind, while I was stubbing my silly toes against that \ncursed pyramid so confoundedly contradictory was it \nall, all the while, I say, I was thinking to myself, \"What 's \nhis leg now, but a cane a whalebone cane. Yes,\" \nthinks I, \"it was only a playful cudgelling in fact, only \na whaleboning that he gave me not a base kick. Be- \nsides,\" thinks I, \" look at it once ; why, the end of it \nthe foot part what a small sort of end it is ; whereas, if \na broad-footed farmer kicked me, there 's a devilish broad \ninsult. But this insult is whittled down to a point only.\" \n\nVOL. I. L \n\n\n\n162 MOBY-DICK \n\nBut now comes the greatest joke of the dream, Flask. \nWhile I was battering away at the pyramid, a sort of \nbadger-haired old merman, with a hump on his back, \ntakes me by the shoulders, and slews me round. \" What \nare you 'bout ? \" says he. Slid ! man, but I was \nfrightened. Such a phiz ! But, somehow, next moment \nI was over the fright. \" What am I about ? \" says I at \nlast. \" And what business is that of yours, I should like \nto know, Mr. Humpback ? Do you want a kick ? \" By \nthe lord, Flask, I had no sooner said that, than he turned \nround his stern to me, bent over, and dragging up a lot \nof seaweed he had for a clout what do you think I saw ? \nwhy, thunder alive, man, his stern was stuck full of \nmarling-spikes, with the points out. Says I, on second \nthoughts, \" I guess I won't kick you, old fellow.\" \" Wise \nStubb,\" said he, \" wise Stubb \" ; and kept muttering \nit all the time, a sort of eating of his own gums like a \nchimney hag. Seeing he wasn't going to stop saying \nover his \" wise Stubb, wise Stubb,\" I thought I might as \nwell fall to kicking the pyramid again. But I had only \njust lifted my foot for it, when he roared out, \" Stop that \nkicking ! \" \" Halloa,\" says I, \" what 's the matter now, \nold fellow ? \" \" Look ye here,\" says he ; \" let 's argue \nthe insult. Captain Ahab kicked ye, didn't he ? \" \" Yes, \nhe did,\" says I \"right here it was.\" \"Very good,\" \nsays he \" he used his ivory leg, didn't he ? \" \" Yes, he \ndid,\" says I. \" WeU, then,\" says he, \" wise Stubb, what \nhave you to complain of ? Didn't he kick with right \ngoodwill ? it wasn't a common pitch-pine leg he kicked \nwith, was it ? No, you were kicked by a great man, and \nwith a beautiful ivory leg, Stubb. It 's an honour ; I \nconsider it an honour. Listen, wise Stubb. In old \nEngland the greatest lords think it great glory to be \nslapped by a queen, and made garter-knights of ; but, \nbe your boast, Stubb, that ye were kicked by old Ahab, \n\n\n\nQUEEN MAB 163 \n\nand made a wise man of. Remember what I say ; be \nkicked by him ; account his kicks honours ; and on no \naccount kick back ; for you can't help yourself, wise \nStubb. Don't you see that pyramid ? \" With that, he \nall of a sudden seemed somehow, in some queer fashion, \nto swim off into the air. I snored ; rolled over ; and there \nI was in my hammock ! Now, what do you think of that \ndream, Flask ? ' \n\n4 1 don't know ; it seems a sort of foolish to me, \nthough.' \n\n4 Maybe ; maybe. But it 's made a wise man of me, \nFlask. D' ye see Ahab standing there, sideways looking \nover the stern ? Well, the best thing you can do, Flask, \nis to let that old man alone ; never speak to him, whatever \nhe says. Halloa ! What 's that he shouts ? Hark ! ' \n\n' Mast-head, there ! Look sharp, all of ye ! There are \nwhales hereabouts ! If ye see a white one, split your \nlungs for him ! ' \n\n' What do you think of that now, Flask ? ain't there a \nsmall drop of something queer about that, eh ? A white \nwhale did ye mark that, man ? Look ye there 's \nsomething special in the wind. Stand by for it, Flask. \nAhab has that that 's bloody on his mind. But, mum ; \nhe comes this way.' \n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXII \n\nCETOLOGY \n\nALREADY we are boldly launched upon the deep ; but \nsoon we shall be lost in its unshored, harbourless immen- \nsities. Ere that come to pass ; ere the Pequod'a weedy \nhull rolls side by side with the barnacled hulls of the \nleviathan ; at the outset it is but well to attend to a \nmatter almost indispensable to a thorough appreciative \nunderstanding of the more special leviathanic revelations \nand allusions of all sorts which are to follow. \n\nIt is some systematised exhibition of the whale in his \nbroad genera, that I would now fain put before you. Yet \nis it no easy task. The classification of the constituents \nof a chaos, nothing less is here essayed. Listen to what \nthe best and latest authorities have laid down. \n\n' No branch of Zoology is so much involved as that which \nis entitled Cetology,' says Captain Scoresby, A.D. 1820. \n\n' It is not my intention, were it in my power, to enter \ninto the inquiry as to the true method of dividing the \ncetacea into groups and families. * * * Utter confusion \nexists among the historians of this animal ' (Sperm \nwhale), says Surgeon Beale, A.D. 1839. \n\n' Unfitness to pursue our research in the unfathomable \nwaters.' ' Impenetrable veil covering our knowledge of \nthe cetacea.' ' A field strewn with thorns.' ' All these \nincomplete indications but serve to torture us naturalists.' \n\nThus speak of the whale, the great Cuvier, and John \nHunter, and Lesson, those lights of zoology and anatomy. \nNevertheless, though of real knowledge there be little, \n\n164 \n\n\n\nCETOLOGY 165 \n\nyet of books there are a plenty ; and so in some small \ndegree, with Cetology, or the science of whales. Many are \nthe men, small and great, old and new, landsmen and sea- \nmen, who have at large or in little, written of the whale. \nRun over a few : The Authors of the Bible ; Aristotle ; \nPliny ; Aldrovandi ; Sir Thomas Browne ; Gesner ; \nRay ; Linnaeus ; Rondeletius ; Willoughby ; Green ; \nArtedi ; Sibbald ; Brisson ; Marten ; Lacepede ; Bonne- \nterre ; Desmarest ; Baron Cuvier ; Frederick Cuvier ; \nJohn Hunter ; Owen ; Scoresby ; Beale ; Bennett ; J. \nRoss Browne ; the Author of Miriam Coffin ; Olmstead ; \nand the Rev. T. Cheever. But to what ultimate general- \nising purpose all these have written, the above-cited \nextracts will show. \n\nOf the names in this list of whale authors, only those \nfollowing Owen ever saw living whales ; and but one of \nthem was a real professional harpooneer and whaleman. \nI mean Captain Scoresby. On the separate subject of \nthe Greenland or Right whale, he is the best existing \nauthority. But Scoresby knew nothing and says nothing \nof the great Sperm whale, compared with which the Green- \nland whale is almost unworthy mentioning. And here \nbe it said, that the Greenland whale is an usurper upon \nthe throne of the seas. He is not even by any means the \nlargest of the whales. Yet, owing to the long priority \nof his claims, and the profound ignorance which, till some \nseventy years back, invested the then fabulous or utterly \nunknown Sperm whale, and which ignorance to this \npresent day still reigns in all but some few scientific \nretreats and whale -ports ; this usurpation has been every \nway complete. Reference to nearly all the leviathanic \nallusions in the great poets of past days, will satisfy you \nthat the Greenland whale, without one rival, was to them \nthe monarch of the seas. But the time has at last come \nfor a new proclamation. This is Charing Cross ; hear ye ! \n\n\n\n166 MOBY-DICK \n\ngood people all, the Greenland whale is deposed, the \ngreat Sperm whale now reigneth ! \n\nThere are only two books in being which at all pretend \nto put the living Sperm whale before you, and at the same \ntime, in the remotest degree succeed in the attempt. \nThose books are Beale's and Bennett's ; both in their \ntime surgeons to the English South -Sea whale -ships, and \nboth exact and reliable men. The original matter \ntouching the Sperm whale to be found in their volumes is \nnecessarily small ; but so far as it goes, it is of excellent \nquality, though mostly confined to scientific description. \nAs yet, however, the Sperm whale, scientific or poetic, \nlives not complete in any literature. Far above all other \nhunted whales, his is an unwritten life. \n\nNow the various species of whales need some sort of \npopular comprehensive classification, if only an easy \noutline one for the present, hereafter to be filled in all its \ndepartments by subsequent labourers. As no better \nman advances to take this matter in hand, I hereupon \noffer my own poor endeavours. I promise nothing \ncomplete ; because any human thing supposed to be \ncomplete, must for that very reason infallibly be faulty. \nI shall not pretend to a minute anatomical description of \nthe various species, or in this place at least to much of \nany description. My object here is simply to project the \ndraught of a systematisation of Cetology. I am the \narchitect, not the builder. \n\nBut it is a ponderous task ; no ordinary letter-sorter \nin the Post Office is equal to it. To grope down into the \nbottom of the sea after them ; to have one's hands \namong the unspeakable foundations, ribs, and very pelvis \nof the world ; this is a fearful thing. What am I that I \nshould essay to hook the nose of this leviathan ! The \nawful tauntings in Job might well appal me. ' Will he \n(the leviathan) make a covenant with thee ? Behold the \n\n\n\nCETOLOGY 167 \n\nhope of him is vain ! ' But I have swam through libraries \nand sailed through oceans ; I have had to do with whales \nwith these visible hands ; I am in earnest ; and I will \ntry. There are some preliminaries to settle. \n\nFirst : The uncertain, unsettled condition of this \nscience of Cetology is in the very vestibule attested by \nthe fact, that in some quarters it still remains a moot point \nwhether a whale be a fish. In his System of Nature, \nA.D. 1776, Linnaeus declares, ' I hereby separate the whales \nfrom the fish. 5 But of my own knowledge, I know that \ndown to the year 1850, sharks and shad, ale wives and \nherring, against Linnaeus 's express edict, were still found \ndividing the possession of the same seas with the leviathan. \n\nThe grounds upon which Linnaeus would fain have \nbanished the whales from the waters, he states as follows : \n' On account of their warm bilocular heart, their lungs, \ntheir movable eyelids, their hollow ears, penem intrantem \nfeminam mammis lactantem,' and finally, ' ex lege naturae \njure meritoque.' I submitted all this to my friends \nSimeon Macey and Charley Coffin, of Nantucket, both \nmessmates of mine in a certain voyage, and they united \nin the opinion that the reasons set forth were altogether \ninsufficient . Charley profanely hinted they were humbug . \n\nBe it known that, waiving all argument, I take the good \nold-fashioned ground that the whale is a fish, and call \nupon holy Jonah to back me. This fundamental thing \nsettled, the next point is, in what internal respect does \nthe whale differ from other fish. Above, Linnaeus has \ngiven you those items. But in brief, they are those : \nlungs and warm blood ; whereas, all other fish are lung- \nless and cold-blooded. \n\nNext : how shall we define the whale, by his obvious \nexternals, so as conspicuously to label him for all time to \ncome ? To be short, then, a whale is a spouting fish with \na horizontal tail. There you have him. However con- \n\n\n\n168 MOBY-DICK \n\ntraded, that definition is the result of expanded medita- \ntion. A walrus spouts much like a whale, but the walrus \nis not a fish, because he is amphibious. But the last term \nof the definition is still more cogent, as coupled with the \nfirst. Almost any one must have noticed that all the \nfish familiar to landsmen have not a flat, but a vertical, \nor up-and-down tail. Whereas, among spouting fish the \ntail, though it may be similarly shaped, invariably assumes \na horizontal position. \n\nBy the above definition of what a whale is, I do by no \nmeans exclude from the leviathanic brotherhood any sea- \ncreature hitherto identified with the whale by the best- \ninformed Nantucketers ; nor, on the other hand, link \nwith it any fish hitherto authoritatively regarded as alien. 1 \nHence, all the smaller, spouting, and horizontal-tailed fish \nmust be included in this ground-plan of Cetology. Now, \nthen, come the grand divisions of the entire whale host. \n\nFirst : According to magnitude I divide the whales into \nthree primary BOOKS (subdivisible into CHAPTERS), and \nthese shall comprehend them all, both small and large. \n\nI. The FOLIO WHALE ; II. the OCTAVO WHALE ; \nIII. the DUODECIMO WHALE. \n\nAs the type of the FOLIO I present the Sperm Whale ; \nof the OCTAVO, the Grampus ; of the DUODECIMO, the \nPorpoise. \n\nFOLIOS. Among these I here include the following \nchapters : I. the Sperm Whale ; II. the Right Whale ; \nIII. the Fin-lack Whale ; IV. the Hump-backed Whale \\ \nV. the Razor-back Whale ; VI. the Sulphur-bottom Whale. \n\nBOOK I. (Folio), CHAPTER I. (Sperm Whale). This \n\n1 I am aware that down to the present time, the fish styled Lamatins \nand Dugongs (Pig-fish and Sow-fish of the Coffins of Nantucket) are \nincluded by many naturalists among the whales. But as these pig-fish \nare a nosy, contemptible set, mostly lurking in the mouths of rivers, and \nfeeding on wet hay, and especially as they do not spout, I deny their \ncredentials as whales ; and have presented them with their passports to \nquit the Kingdom of Cetology. \n\n\n\nCETOLOGY 169 \n\nwhale, among the English of old vaguely known as the \nTrumpa whale, and the Physeter whale, and the Anvil- \nheaded whale, is the present Cachalot of the French, and \nthe Pottsfisch of the Germans, and the Macrocephalus \nof the Long Words. He is, without doubt, the largest \ninhabitant of the globe ; the most formidable of all \nwhales to encounter ; the most majestic in aspect ; and \nlastly, by far the most valuable in commerce ; he being \nthe only creature from which that valuable substance, \nspermaceti, is obtained. All his peculiarities will, in \nmany other places, be enlarged upon. It is chiefly with \nhis name that I now have to do. Philologically con- \nsidered, it is absurd. Some centuries ago, when the \nSperm whale was almost wholly unknown in his own \nproper individuality, and when his oil was only accident- \nally obtained from the stranded fish ; in those days \nspermaceti, it would seem, was popularly supposed to be \nderived from a creature identical with the one then known \nin England as the Greenland or Right whale. It was \nthe idea also, that this same spermaceti was that quicken- \ning humour of the Greenland whale which the first \nsyllable of the word literally expresses. In those times, \nalso, spermaceti was exceedingly scarce, not being used \nfor light, but only as an ointment and medicament. It \nwas only to be had from the druggists as you nowadays \nbuy an ounce of rhubarb. When, as I opine, in the course \nof time, the true nature of spermaceti became known, its \noriginal name was still retained by the dealers ; no doubt \nto enhance its value by a notion so strangely significant \nof its scarcity. And so the appellation must at last have \ncome to be bestowed upon the whale from which this \nspermaceti was really derived. \n\nBOOK I. (Folio), CHAPTER II. (Right Whale). In one \nrespect this is the most venerable of the leviathans, being \nthe one first regularly hunted by man. It yields the \n\n\n\n170 MOBY-DICK \n\narticle commonly known as whalebone or baleen ; and \nthe oil specially known as ' whale oil,' an inferior article \nin commerce. Among the fishermen, he is indiscrimin- \nately designated by all the following titles : The Whale ; \nthe Greenland Whale ; the Black Whale ; the Great \nWhale ; the True Whale ; the Right Whale. There is a \ndeal of obscurity concerning the identity of the species \nthus multitudinously baptized. What then is the whale, \nwhich I include in the second species of my Folios ? It is \nthe Great Mysticetus of the English naturalists ; the \nGreenland Whale of the English whalemen ; the Baleine \nOrdinaire of the French whalemen ; the Growlands Wal- \nfisch of the Swedes. It is the whale which for more than \ntwo centuries past has been hunted by the Dutch and \nEnglish in the Arctic seas ; it is the whale which the \nAmerican fishermen have long pursued in the Indian \nOcean, on the Brazil Banks, on the Nor '-West Coast, and \nvarious other parts of the world, designated by them \nRight Whale Cruising-Grounds. \n\nSome pretend to see a difference between the Greenland \nwhale of the English and the Right whale of the Ameri- \ncans. But they precisely agree in all their grand features ; \nnor has there yet been presented a single determinate \nfact upon which to ground a radical distinction. It is \nby endless subdivisions based upon the most inconclusive \ndifferences, that some departments of natural history \nbecome so repellingly intricate. The Right whale will \nbe elsewhere treated of at some length, with reference to \nelucidating the Sperm whale. \n\nBOOK I. (Folio), CHAPTER III. (Fin-back). Under \nthis head I reckon a monster which, by the various names \nof Fin-back, Tall-spout, and Long-John, has been seen \nalmost in every sea and is commonly the whale whose \ndistant jet is so often descried by passengers crossing the \nAtlantic, in the New York packet -tracks. In the length \n\n\n\nCETOLOGY 171 \n\nhe attains, and in his baleen, the Fin-back resembles the \nRight whale, but is of a less portly girth, and a lighter \ncolour, approaching to olive. His great lips present a \ncable-like aspect, formed by the intertwisting, slanting \nfolds of large wrinkles. His grand distinguishing feature, \nthe fin, from which he derives his name, is often a con- \nspicuous object. This fin is some three or four feet long, \ngrowing vertically from the hinder part of the back, of \nan angular shape, and with a very sharp-pointed end. \nEven if not the slightest other part of the creature be \nvisible, this isolated fin will, at times, be seen plainly \nprojecting from the surface. When the sea is moderately \ncalm, and slightly marked with spherical ripples, and this \ngnomon-like fin stands up and casts shadows upon the \nwrinkled surface, it may well be supposed that the watery \ncircle surrounding it somewhat resembles a dial, with its \nstyle and wavy hour-lines graved on it. On that Ahaz- \ndial the shadow often goes back. The Fin-back is not \ngregarious. He seems a whale-hater, as some men are \nman-haters. Very shy ; always going solitary ; unex- \npectedly rising to the surface in the remotest and most \nsullen waters ; his straight and single lofty jet rising like \na tall misanthropic spear upon a barren plain ; gifted with \nsuch wondrous power and velocity in swimming, as to \ndefy all present pursuit from man ; this leviathan seems \nthe banished and unconquerable Cain of his race, bearing \nfor his mark that style upon his back. From having the \nbaleen in his mouth, the Fin-back is sometimes included \nwith the Right whale, among a theoretic species denomin- \nated Whalebone whales, that is, whales with baleen. Of \nthese so-called Whalebone whales, there would seem to be \nseveral varieties, most of which, however, are little known. \nBroad-nosed whales and Beaked whales ; Pike -headed \nwhales ; Bunched whales ; Under- jawed whales and \nRostrated whales, are the fishermen's names for a few sorts. \n\n\n\n172 MOBY-DICK \n\nIn connection with this appellative of ' Whalebone \nwhales/ it is of great importance to mention, that how- \never such a nomenclature may be convenient in facilitat- \ning allusions to some kind of whales, yet it is in vain to \nattempt a clear classification of the leviathan, founded \nupon either his baleen, or hump, or fin, or teeth ; not- \nwithstanding that those marked parts or features very \nobviously seem better adapted to afford the basis for a \nregular system of Cetology than any other detached \nbodily distinctions, which the whale, in his kinds, presents. \nHow then ? The baleen, hump, back-fin, and teeth ; \nthese are things whose peculiarities are indiscriminately \ndispersed among all sorts of whales, without any regard \nto what may be the nature of their structure in other and \nmore essential particulars. Thus, the Sperm whale and \nthe Hump-backed whale, each has a hump ; but there \nthe similitude ceases. Then, this same Hump-backed \nwhale and the Greenland whale, each of these has baleen ; \nbut there again the similitude ceases. And it is just the \nsame with the other parts above mentioned. In various \nsorts of whales, they form such irregular combinations ; \nor, in the case of any one of them detached, such an \nirregular isolation ; as utterly to defy all general methodis- \nation formed upon such a basis. On this rock every one \nof the whale -naturalists has split. \n\nBut it may possibly be conceived that, in the internal \nparts of the whale, in his anatomy there, at least, we \nshall be able to hit the right classification. Nay : what \nthing, for example, is there in the Greenland whale's \nanatomy more striking than his baleen ? Yet we have \nseen that by his baleen it is impossible correctly to classify \nthe Greenland whale. And if you descend into the bowels \nof the various leviathans, why there you will not find \ndistinctions a fiftieth part as available to the systematiser \nas those external ones already enumerated. What then \n\n\n\nCETOLOGY 173 \n\nremains ? nothing but to take hold of the whales bodily, \nin their entire liberal volume, and boldly sort them that \nway. And this is the Bibliographical system here adopted ; \nand it is the only one that can possibly succeed, for it \nalone is practicable. To proceed. \n\nBOOK I. (Folio), CHAPTER IV. (Hump-back). This \nwhale is often seen on the northern American coast. He \nhas been frequently captured there, and towed into \nharbour. He has a great pack on him like a peddler ; or \nyou might call him the Elephant and Castle whale. At \nany rate, the popular name for him does not sufficiently \ndistinguish him, since the Sperm whale also has a hump, \nthough a smaller one. His oil is not very valuable. He \nhas baleen. He is the most gamesome and light-hearted \nof all the whales, making more gay foam and white water \ngenerally than any other of them. \n\nBOOK I. (Folio), CHAPTER V. (Razor-back). Of this \nwhale little is known but his name. I have seen him at a \ndistance off Cape Horn. Of a retiring nature, he eludes \nboth hunters and philosophers. Though no coward, he \nhas never yet shown any part of him but his back, which \nrises in a long sharp ridge. Let him go. I know little \nmore of him, nor does anybody else. \n\nBOOK I. (Folio), CHAPTER VI. (Sulphur-bottom). \nAnother retiring gentleman, with a brimstone belly, \ndoubtless got by scraping along the Tartarian tiles in \nsome of his profounder divings. He is seldom seen ; at \nleast I have never seen him except in the remoter Southern \nseas, and then always at too great a distance to study his \ncountenance. He is never chased ; he would run away \nwith rope -walks of line. Prodigies are told of him. \nAdieu, Sulphur-bottom ! I can say nothing more that is \ntrue of ye, nor can the oldest Nantucketer. \n\nThus ends BOOK I. (Folio), and now begins BOOK II, \n(Octavo). \n\n\n\n174 MOBY-DICK \n\nOCTAVOS. 1 These embrace the whales of middling \nmagnitude, among which at present may be numbered : \nI. the Grampus ; II. the Black Fish ; III. the Narwhale ; \nIV. the Killer ; V. the Thrasher. \n\nBOOK II. (Octavo), CHAPTER I. (Grampus). Though \nthis fish, whose loud sonorous breathing, or rather blowing, \nhas furnished a proverb to landsmen, is so well known \na denizen of the deep, yet is he not popularly classed \namong whales. But possessing all the grand distinctive \nfeatures of the leviathan, most naturalists have recog- \nnised him for one. He is of moderate octavo size, varying \nfrom fifteen to twenty-five feet in length, and of corre- \nsponding dimensions round the waist. He swims in \nherds ; he is never regularly hunted, though his oil is \nconsiderable in quantity, and pretty good for light. By \nsome fishermen his approach is regarded as premonitory \nof the advance of the great Sperm whale. \n\nBOOK II. (Octavo), CHAPTER II. (Black Fish). I give \nthe popular fishermen's names for all these fish, for gener- \nally they are the best. Where any name happens to be \nvague or inexpressive, I shall say so, and suggest another. \nI do so now, touching the Black Fish, so called, because \nblackness is the rule among almost all whales. So, call \nhim the Hyena whale, if you please. His voracity is well \nknown, and from the circumstance that the inner angles \nof his lips are curved upward, he carries an everlasting \nMephistophelean grin on his face. This whale averages \nsome sixteen or eighteen feet in length. He is found in \nalmost all latitudes. He has a peculiar way of showing \nhis dorsal hooked fin in swimming, which looks something \nlike a Roman nose. When not more profitably employed, \n\n1 Why this book of whales is not denominated the Quarto is very plain. \nBecause, while the whales of this order, though smaller than those of the \nformer order, nevertheless retain a proportionate likeness to them in figure, \nyet the bookbinder's Quarto volume in its diminished form does not \npreserve the shape of the Folio volume, but the Octavo volume does. \n\n\n\nCETOLOGY 175 \n\nthe Sperm-whale hunters sometimes capture the Hyena \nwhale, to keep up the supply of cheap oil for domestic \nemployment as some frugal housekeepers, in the absence \nof company, and quite alone by themselves, burn un- \nsavoury tallow instead of odorous wax. Though their \nblubber is very thin, some of these whales will yield you \nupward of thirty gallons of oil. \n\nBOOK II. (Octavo), CHAPTER III. (Narwhale), that is, \nNostril Whale. Another instance of a curiously named \nwhale, so named I suppose from his peculiar horn being \noriginally mistaken for a peaked nose. The creature is \nsome sixteen feet in length, while its horn averages five \nfeet, though some exceed ten, and even attain to fifteen \nfeet. Strictly speaking, this horn is but a lengthened \ntusk, growing out from the jaw in a line a little depressed \nfrom the horizontal. But it is only found on the sinister \nside, which has an ill effect, giving its owner something \nanalogous to the aspect of a clumsy left-handed man. \nWhat precise purpose this ivory horn or lance answers, it \nwould be hard to say. It does not seem to be used like \nthe blade of the sword-fish and bill-fish ; though some \nsailors tell me that the Narwhale employs it for a rake \nin turning over the bottom of the sea for food. Charley \nCoffin said it was used for an ice-piercer ; for the Nar- \nwhale, rising to the surface of the Polar Sea, and finding \nit sheeted with ice, thrusts his horn up, and so breaks \nthrough. But you cannot prove either of these surmises \nto be correct. My own opinion is, that however this one- \nsided horn may really be used by the Narwhale however \nthat may be it would certainly be very convenient to \nhim for a folder in reading pamphlets. The Narwhale \nI have heard called the Tusked whale, the Horned whale, \nand the Unicorn whale. He is certainly a curious \nexample of the Unicornism to be found in almost every \nkingdom of animated nature. From certain cloistered \n\n\n\n176 MOBY-DICK \n\nold authors I have gathered that this same sea-unicorn's \nhorn was in ancient days regarded as the great antidote \nagainst poison, and as such, preparations of it brought \nimmense prices. It was also distilled to a volatile salts \nfor fainting ladies, the same way that the horns of the \nmale deer are manufactured into hartshorn. Originally \nit was in itself accounted an object of great curiosity. \nBlack Letter tells me that Sir Martin Frobisher on his \nreturn from that voyage, when Queen Bess did gallantly \nwave her jewelled hand to him from a window of Green- \nwich Palace, as his bold ship sailed down the Thames ; \n' when Sir Martin returned from that voyage,' saith Black \nLetter, ' on bended knees he presented to her highness \na prodigious long horn of the Narwhale, which for a long \nperiod after hung in the castle at Windsor.' An Irish \nauthor avers that the Earl of Leicester, on bended knees, \ndid likewise present to her highness another horn, per- \ntaining to a land-beast of the unicorn nature. \n\nThe Narwhale has a very picturesque, leopard-like look, \nbeing of a milk-white ground colour, dotted with round \nand oblong spots of black. His oil is very superior, clear \nand fine ; but there is little of it, and he is seldom hunted. \nHe is mostly found in the circumpolar seas. \n\nBOOK II. (Octavo), CHAPTER IV. (Killer). Of this \nwhale little is precisely known to the Nantucketer, and \nnothing at all to the professed naturalist. From what I \nhave seen of him at a distance, I should say that he was \nabout the bigness of a grampus. He is very savage a \nsort of Feegee fish. He sometimes takes the great Folio \nwhale by the lip, and hangs there like a leech, till the \nmighty brute is worried to death. The Killer is never \nhunted. I never heard what sort of oil he has. Excep- \ntion might be taken to the name bestowed upon this whale, \non the ground of its indistinctness. For we are all killers, \non land and on sea ; Bonapartes and Sharks included. \n\n\n\nCETOLOGY 177 \n\nBOOK II. (Octavo), CHAPTER V. (Thrasher). This \ngentleman is famous for his tail, which he uses for a \nferule in thrashing his foes. He mounts the Folio \nwhale's back, and as he swims, he works his passage by \nflogging him ; as some schoolmasters get along in the \nworld by a similar process. Still less is known of the \nThrasher than of the Killer. Both are outlaws, even in \nthe lawless seas. \n\nThus ends BOOK II. (Octavo), and begins BOOK III. \n(Duodecimo). \n\nDUODECIMOS. These include the smaller whales: \nI. the Huzza Porpoise ; II. the Algerine Porpoise ; III. \nthe Mealy-mouthed Porpoise. \n\nTo those who have not chanced specially to study the \nsubject, it may possibly seem strange, that fishes not \ncommonly exceeding four or five feet should be marshalled \namong WHALES a word which, in the popular sense, \nalways conveys an idea of hugeness. But the creatures \nset down above as Duodecimos are infallibly whales, by \nthe terms of my definition of what a whale is i.e. a \nspouting fish, with a horizontal tail. \n\nBOOK III. (Duodecimo), CHAPTER I. (Huzza Porpoise). \nThis is the common porpoise found almost all over the \nglobe. The name is of my own bestowal ; for there are \nmore than one sort of porpoises, and something must be \ndone to distinguish them. I call him thus, because he \nalways swims in hilarious shoals, which upon the broad \nsea keep tossing themselves to heaven like caps in a \nFourth-of-July crowd. Their appearance is generally \nhailed with delight by the mariner. Full of fine spirits, \nthey invariably come from the breezy billows to windward. \nThey are the lads that always live before the wind. They \nare accounted a lucky omen. If you yourself can with- \nstand three cheers at beholding these vivacious fish, then \nheaven help ye ; the spirit of godly gamesomeness is not \n\nVOL. I. M \n\n\n\n178 MOBY-DICK \n\nin ye. A well-fed, plump Huzza porpoise will yield you \none good gallon of good oil. But the fine and delicate \nfluid extracted from his jaws is exceedingly valuable. \nIt is in request among jewellers and watchmakers. Sailors \nput it on their hones. Porpoise meat is good eating, you \nknow. It may never have occurred to you that a por- \npoise spouts. Indeed, his spout is so small that it is not \nvery readily discernible. But the next time you have a \nchance, watch him ; and you will then see the great \nSperm whale himself in miniature. \n\nBOOK III. (Duodecimo), CHAPTER II. (Algerine Por- \npoise). A pirate. Very savage. He is only found, I \nthink, in the Pacific. He is somewhat larger than the \nHuzza porpoise, but much of the same general make. \nProvoke him, and he will buckle to a shark. I have \nlowered for him many times, but never yet saw him \ncaptured. \n\nBOOK III. (Duodecimo), CHAPTER III. (Mealy-mouthed \nPorpoise). The largest kind of porpoise ; and only \nfound in the Pacific, so far as it is known. The only \nEnglish name, by which he has hitherto been designated, \n,is that of the fishers Right-whale porpoise, from the \ncircumstance that he is chiefly found in the vicinity of \nthat Folio. In shape, he differs in some degree from the \nHuzza porpoise, being of a less rotund and jolly girth ; \nindeed, he is of quite a neat and gentleman -like figure. \nHe has no fins on his back (most other porpoises have), \nhe has a lovely tail, and sentimental Indian eyes of a \nhazel hue. But his mealy-mouth spoils all. Though \nhis entire back down to his side fins is of a deep sable, \nyet a boundary line, distinct as the mark in a ship's \nhull, called the ' bright waist/ that line streaks him from \nstem to stern, with two separate colours, black above and \nwhite below. The white comprises part of his head, and \nthe whole of his mouth, which makes him look as if he \nhad just escaped from a felonious visit to a meal -bag. \n\n\n\nCETOLOGY 179 \n\nA most mean and mealy aspect ! His oil is much like \n\nthat of the common porpoise. \n\n******* \n\nBeyond the DUODECIMO, this system does not proceed, \ninasmuch as the porpoise is the smallest of the whales. \nAbove, you have all the leviathans of note. But there \nare a rabble of uncertain, fugitive, half-fabulous whales, \nwhich, as an American whaleman, I know by reputation, \nbut not personally. I shall enumerate them by their \nforecastle appellations ; for possibly such a list may be \nvaluable to future investigators, who may complete what \nI have here but begun. If any of the following whales \nshall hereafter be caught and marked, then he can readily \nbe incorporated into this system, according to his Folio, \nOctavo, or Duodecimo magnitude : The Bottle-nose \nWhale ; the Junk Whale ; the Pudding-headed Whale ; \nthe Cape Whale ; the Leading Whale ; the Cannon \nWhale ; the Scragg Whale ; the Coppered Whale ; the \nElephant Whale ; the Iceberg Whale ; the Quog Whale ; \nthe Blue Whale, etc. From Icelandic, Dutch, and old \nEnglish authorities, there might be quoted other lists of \nuncertain whales, blessed with all manner of uncouth \nnames. But I omit them as altogether obsolete ; and \ncan hardly help suspecting them for mere sounds, full of \nleviathanism, but signifying nothing. \n\nFinally : It was stated at the outset, that this system \nwould not be here, and at once, perfected. You cannot \nbut plainly see that I have kept my word. But I now \nleave my cetological system standing thus unfinished, even \nas the great Cathedral of Cologne was left, with the crane \nstill standing upon the top of the uncompleted tower. \nFor small erections may be finished by their first archi- \ntects ; grand ones, true ones, ever leave the cope-stone to \nposterity. God keep me from ever completing anything. \nThis whole book is but a draught nay, but the draught \nof a draught. Oh, Time, Strength, Cash, and Patience ! \n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIII \n\nTHE SPECKSYNDER \n\nCONCERNING the officers of the whale-craft, this seems \nas good a place as any to set down a little domestic \npeculiarity on shipboard, arising from the existence of \nthe harpooneer class of officers, a class unknown of course \nin any other marine than the whale-fleet. \n\nThe large importance attached to the harpooneer J s \nvocation is evinced by the fact, that originally in the old \nDutch Fishery, two centuries and more ago, the command \nof a whale -ship was not wholly lodged in the person now \ncalled the captain, but was divided between him and an \nofficer called the Specksynder. Literally this word \nmeans Fat -Cutter ; usage, however, in time made it \nequivalent to Chief Harpooneer. In those days, the \ncaptain's authority was restricted to the navigation and \ngeneral management of the vessel : while over the whale- \nhunting department and all its concerns, the Specksynder \nor Chief Harpooneer reigned supreme. In the British \nGreenland Fishery, under the corrupted title of Speck- \nsioneer, this old Dutch official is still retained, but his \nformer dignity is sadly abridged. At present he ranks \nsimply as senior Harpooneer ; and as such, is but one of \nthe captain's more inferior subalterns. Nevertheless, as \nupon the good conduct of the harpooneers the success of \na whaling voyage largely depends, and since in the Ameri- \ncan Fishery he is not only an important officer in the boat, \nbut under certain circumstances (night-watches on a \nwhaling -ground) the command of the ship's deck is also \n\n180 \n\n\n\nTHE SPECKSYNDER 181 \n\nhis ; therefore the grand political maxim of the sea \ndemands, that he should nominally live apart from the \nmen before the mast, and be in some way distinguished \nas their professional superior ; though always, by them, \nfamiliarly regarded as their social equal. \n\nNow, the grand distinction drawn between officer and \nman at sea is this the first lives aft, the last forward. \nHence, in whale-ships and merchantmen alike, the mates \nhave their quarters with the captain ; and so, too, in \nmost of the American whalers the harpooneers are lodged \nin the after part of the ship. That is to say, they take \ntheir meals in the captain's cabin, and sleep in a place \nindirectly communicating with it. \n\nThough the long period of a Southern whaling voyage \n(by far the longest of all voyages now or ever made by \nman), the peculiar perils of it, and the community of \ninterest prevailing among a company, all of whom, high \nor low, depend for their profits, not upon fixed wages, \nbut upon their common luck, together with their common \nvigilance, intrepidity, and hard work ; though all these \nthings do in some cases tend to beget a less rigorous \ndiscipline than in merchantmen generally ; yet, never \nmind how much like an old Mesopotamian family these \nwhalemen may, in some primitive instances, live together ; \nfor all that, the punctilious externals, at least, of the \nquarter-deck are seldom materially relaxed, and in no \ninstance done away. Indeed, many are the Nantucket \nships in which you will see the skipper parading his \nquarter-deck with an elated grandeur not surpassed in \nany military navy ; nay, extorting almost as much out- \nward homage as if he wore the imperial purple, and not \nthe shabbiest of pilot-cloth. \n\nAnd though of all men the moody captain of the Pequod \nwas the least given to that sort of shallowest assumption ; \nand though the only homage he ever exacted was im- \n\n\n\n182 MOBY-DICK \n\nplicit, instantaneous obedience ; though he required no \nman to remove the shoes from his feet ere stepping upon \nthe quarter-deck ; and though there were times when, \nowing to peculiar circumstances connected with events \nhereafter to be detailed, he addressed them in unusual \nterms, whether of condescension or in terrorem, or other- \nwise ; yet even Captain Ahab was by no means unob- \nservant of the paramount forms and usages of the sea. \n\nNor, perhaps, will it fail to be eventually perceived, that \nbehind those forms and usages, as it were, he sometimes \nmasked himself ; incidentally making use of them for \nother and more private ends than they were legitimately \nintended to subserve. That certain sultanism of his \nbrain, which had otherwise in a good degree remained \nunmanifested ; through those forms that same sultanism \n/became incarnate in an irresistible dictatorship. For be a \nman's intellectual superiority what it will, it can never \nassume the practical, available supremacy over other men, \nwithout the aid of some sort of external arts and entrench- \nments, always, in themselves, more or less paltry and base. \nThis it is, that forever keeps God's true princes of the \nEmpire from the world's hustings ; and leaves the highest \nhonours that this air can give, to those men who become \nfamous more through their infinite inferiority to the choice \nhidden handful of the Divine Inert, than through their \nundoubted superiority over the dead level of the mass. \nSuch large virtue lurks in these small things when extreme \npolitical superstitions invest them, that in some royal \ninstances even to idiot imbecility they have imparted \npotency. But when, as in the case of Nicholas the Czar, \nthe ringed crown of geographical empire encircles an \nimperial brain ; then, the plebeian herds crouch abased \nbefore the tremendous centralisation. Nor will the \ntragic dramatist who would depict mortal indomitable - \nness in its fullest sweep and direct swing, ever forget a \n\n\n\nTHE SPECKS YNDER 183 \n\nhint, incidentally so important in his art, as the one now \nalluded to. \n\nBut Ahab, my captain, still moves before me in all \nhis Nantucket grimness and shagginess ; and in this \nepisode touching emperors and kings, I must not conceal \nthat I have only to do with a poor old whale-hunter like \nhim ; and, therefore, all outward majestical trappings \nand housings are denied me. Oh, Ahab ! what shall be \ngrand in thee, it must needs be plucked at from the skies, \nand dived for in the deep, and featured in the unbodied \nair ! \n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIV \n\nTHE CABIN-TABLE \n\nIT is noon ; and Dough-Boy, the steward, thrusting his \npale loaf-of-bread face from the cabin-scuttle, announces \ndinner to his lord and master ; who, sitting in the lee \nquarter-boat, has just been taking an observation of the \nsun ; and is now mutely reckoning the latitude on the \nsmooth, medallion-shaped tablet, reserved for that daily \npurpose on the upper part of his ivory leg. From his \ncomplete inattention to the tidings, you would think that \nmoody Ahab had not heard his menial. But presently, \ncatching hold of the mizen shrouds, he swings himself \nto the deck, and in an even, unexhilarated voice, saying, \n'Dinner, Mr. Starbuck,' disappears into the .cabin. \n\nWhen the last echo of his sultan's step has died away, \nand Starbuck, the first Emir, has every reason to suppose \nthat he is seated, then Starbuck rouses from his quietude, \ntakes a few turns along the planks, and, after a grave peep \ninto the binnacle, says, with some touch of pleasantness, \n' Dinner, Mr. Stubb,' and descends the scuttle. The \nsecond Emir lounges about the rigging a while, and then \nslightly shaking the main-brace, to see whether it be \nall right with that important rope, he likewise takes up \nthe old burden, and with a rapid * Dinner, Mr. Flask,' \nfollows after his predecessors. \n\nBut the third Emir, now seeing himself all alone on the \nquarter-deck, seems to feel relieved from some curious \nrestraint ; for, tipping all sorts of knowing winks in all \nsorts of directions, and kicking off his shoes, he strikes \n\n184 \n\n\n\nTHE CABIN-TABLE 185 \n\ninto a sharp but noiseless squall of a hornpipe right over \nthe Grand Turk's head ; and then, by a dexterous sleight, \npitching his cap up into the mizen-top for a shelf, he goes \ndown rollicking, so far at least as he remains visible from \nthe deck, reversing all other processions by bringing up \nthe rear with music. But ere stepping into the cabin \ndoorway below, he pauses, ships a new face altogether, \nand then, independent, hilarious little Flask enters King \nAhab's presence, in the character of Abjectus, or the \nSlave. \n\nIt is not the least among the strange things bred by the \nintense artificialness of sea-usages, that while in the open \nair of the deck some officers will, upon provocation, bear \nthemselves boldly and defyingly enough toward their com- \nmander ; yet, ten to one, let those very officers the next \nmoment go down to their customary dinner in that same \ncommander's cabin, and straightway their inoffensive, \nnot to say deprecatory and humble air toward him, as \nhe sits at the head of the table ; this is marvellous, some- \ntimes most comical. Wherefore this difference ? A \nproblem ? Perhaps not. To have been Belshazzar, \nKing of Babylon ; and to have been Belshazzar, not \nhaughtily but courteously, therein certainly must have \nbeen some touch of mundane grandeur. But he who in \nthe rightly regal and intelligent spirit presides over his \nown private dinner-table of invited guests, that man's \nunchallenged power and dominion of individual influ- \nence for the time ; that man's royalty of state transcends \nBelshazzar 's, for Belshazzar was not the greatest. Who \nhas but once dined his friends, has tasted what it is to be \nCaesar. It is a witchery of social czarship which there \nis no withstanding. Now, if to this consideration you \nsuperadd the official supremacy of a shipmaster, then, \nby inference, you will derive the cause of that peculiarity \nof sea-life just mentioned. \n\n\n\n186 MOBY-DICK \n\nOver his ivory-inlaid table, Ahab presided like a mute, \nmaned sea-lion on the white coral beach, surrounded by \nhis warlike but still deferential cubs. In his own proper \nturn, each officer waited to be served. They were as \nlittle children before Ahab ; and yet, in Ahab, there \nseemed not to lurk the smallest social arrogance. With \none mind, their intent eyes all fastened upon the old man's \nknife, as he carved the chief dish before him. I do not \nsuppose that for the world they would have profaned \nthat moment with the slightest observation, even upon \nso neutral a topic as the weather. No ! And when \nreaching out his knife and fork, between which the slice \nof beef was locked, Ahab thereby motioned Starbuck's \nplate toward him, the mate received his meat as though \nreceiving alms ; and cut it tenderly ; and a little started \nif, perchance, the knife grazed against the plate ; and \nchewed it noiselessly ; and swallowed it, not without \ncircumspection. For, like the Coronation banquet at \nFrankfort, where the German Emperor profoundly dines \nwith the seven Imperial Electors, so these cabin meals \nwere somehow solemn meals, eaten in awful silence ; and \nyet at table old Ahab forbade not conversation ; only he \nhimself was dumb. What a relief it was to choking Stubb, \nwhen a rat made a sudden racket in the hold below. And \npoor little Flask, he was the youngest son, and little boy \nof this weary family party. His were the shin-bones \nof the saline beef ; his would have been the drumsticks. \nFor Flask to have presumed to help himself, this must \nhave seemed to him tantamount to larceny in the first \ndegree. Had he helped himself at that table, doubtless, \nnever more would he have been able to hold his head up \nin this honest world ; nevertheless, strange to say, Ahab \nnever forbade him. And had Flask helped himself, the \nchances were Ahab had never so much as noticed it. \nLeast of all, did Flask presume to help himself to butter. \n\n\n\nTHE CABIN-TABLE 187 \n\nWhether he thought the owners of the ship denied it to \nhim, on account of its clotting his clear, sunny com- \nplexion ; or whether he deemed that, on so long a voyage \nin such marketless waters, butter was at a premium, and \ntherefore was not for him, a subaltern ; however it was, \nFlask, alas ! was a butterless man ! \n\nAnother thing. Flask was the last person down at the \ndinner, and Flask is the first man up. Consider ! For \nhereby Flask's dinner was badly jammed in point of time. \nStarbuck and Stubb both had the start of him ; and yet \nthey also have the privilege of lounging in the rear. If \nStubb even, who is but a peg higher than Flask, happens \nto have but a small appetite, and soon shows symptoms \nof concluding his repast, then Flask must bestir himself, \nhe will not get more than three mouthfuls that day ; for \nit is against holy usage for Stubb to precede Flask to the \ndeck. Therefore it was that Flask once admitted in \nprivate, that ever since he had arisen to the dignity of an \nofficer, from that moment he had never known what it \nwas to be otherwise than hungry, more or less. For \nwhat he ate did not so much relieve his hunger, as keep \nit immortal hi him. Peace and satisfaction, thought \nFlask, have forever departed from my stomach. I am \nan officer ; but, how I wish I could fist a bit of old- \nfashioned beef in the forecastle, as I used to when I was \nbefore the mast. There 's the fruits of promotion now ; \nthere 's the vanity of glory : there 's the insanity of life ! \nBesides, if it were so that any mere sailor of the Pequod \nhad a grudge against Flask in Flask's official capacity, all \nthat sailor had to do, in order to obtain ample vengeance, \nwas to go aft at dinner-time, and get a peep at Flask \nthrough the cabin skylight, sitting silly and dumfoundered \nbefore awful Ahab. \n\nNow, Ahab and his three mates formed what may be \ncalled the first table in the Pequod' s cabin. After their \n\n\n\n188 MOBY-DICK \n\ndeparture, taking place in inverted order to their arrival, \nthe canvas cloth was cleared, or rather was restored to \nsome hurried order by the pallid steward. And then the \nthree harpooneers were bidden to the feast, they being \nits residuary legatees. They made a sort of temporary \nservants' hall of the high and mighty cabin. \n\nIn strange contrast to the hardly tolerable constraint \nand nameless invisible domineerings of the captain's table, \nwas the entire care -free licence and ease, the almost frantic \ndemocracy of those inferior fellows the harpooneers. \nWhile their masters, the mates, seemed afraid of the \nsound of the hinges of their own jaws, the harpooneers \nchewed their food with such a relish that there was a \nreport to it. They dined like lords ; they filled their \nbellies like Indian ships all day loading with spices. \nSuch portentous appetites had Queequeg and Tashtego, \nthat to fill out the vacancies made by the previous repast, \noften the pale Dough-Boy was fain to bring on a great \nbaron of salt-junk, seemingly quarried out of the solid \nox. And if he were not lively about it, if he did not go \nwith a nimble hop-skip-and-jump, then Tashtego had an \nungeiitlemanly way of accelerating him by darting a fork \nat his back, harpoon- wise. And once Daggoo, seized \nwith a sudden humour, assisted Dough-Boy's memory by \nsnatching him up bodily, and thrusting his head into a \ngreat empty wooden trencher, while Tashtego, knife in \nhand, began laying out the circle preliminary to scalping \nhim. He was naturally a very nervous, shuddering sort \nof little fellow, this broad-faced steward ; the progeny \nof a bankrupt baker and a hospital nurse. And what \nwith the standing spectacle of the black terrific Ahab, \nand the periodical tumultuous visitations of these three \nsavages, Dough-Boy's whole life was one continual lip- \nquiver. Commonly, after seeing the harpooneers fur- \nnished with all things they demanded, he would escape \n\n\n\nTHE CABIN-TABLE 189 \n\nfrom their clutches into his little pantry adjoining, and \nfearfully peep out at them through the blinds of its door, \ntill all was over. \n\nIt was a sight to see Queequeg seated over against \nTashtego, opposing his filed teeth to the Indian's : cross- \nwise to them, Daggoo seated on the floor, for a bench \nwould have brought his hearse-plumed head to the low \ncarlines ; at every motion of his colossal limbs, making \nthe low cabin framework to shake, as when an African \nelephant goes passenger in a ship. But for all this, the \ngreat negro was wonderfully abstemious, not to say dainty. \nIt seemed hardly possible that by such comparatively \nsmall mouthfuls he could keep up the vitality diffused \nthrough so broad, baronial, and superb a person. But, \ndoubtless, this noble savage fed strong and drank deep \nof the abounding element of air ; and through his dilated \nnostrils snuffed in the sublime life of the worlds. Not by \nbeef or by bread are giants made or nourished. But \nQueequeg, he had a mortal, barbaric smack of the lip in \neating an ugly sound enough so much so, that the \ntrembling Dough-Boy almost looked to see whether any \nmarks of teeth lurked in his own lean arms. And when \nhe would hear Tashtego singing out for him to produce \nhimself, that his bones might be picked, the simple -witted \nsteward all but shattered the crockery hanging round him \nin the pantry, by his sudden fits of the palsy. Nor did \nthe whetstone which the harpooneers carried in their \npockets, for their lances and other weapons ; and with \nwhich whetstones, at dinner, they would ostentatiously \nsharpen their knives ; that grating sound did not at all \ntend to tranquillise poor Dough-Boy. How could he \nforget that in his Island days, Queequeg, for one, must \ncertainly have been guilty of some murderous, convivial \nindiscretions. Alas ! Dough-Boy ! hard fares the white \nwaiter who waits upon cannibals. Not a napkin should \n\n\n\n190 MOBY-DICK \n\nhe carry on his arm, but a buckler. In good time, \nthough, to his great delight, the three salt-sea warriors \nwould rise and depart ; to his credulous, fable-mongering \nears, all their martial bones jingling in them at every step, \nlike Moorish scimitars in scabbards. \n\nBut, though these barbarians dined in the cabin, and \nnominally lived there ; still, being anything but seden- \ntary in their habits, they were scarcely ever in it except \nat meal-times, and just before sleeping-time, when they \npassed through it to their own peculiar quarters. \n\nIn this one matter, Ahab seemed no exception to most \nAmerican whale-captains, who, as a set, rather incline to \nthe opinion that by rights the ship's cabin belongs to \nthem ; and that it is by courtesy alone that anybody else \nis, at any time, permitted there. So that, in real truth, \nthe mates and harpooneers of the Pequod might more \nproperly be said to have lived out of the cabin than in \nit. For when they did enter it, it was something as a \nstreet-door enters a house ; turning inward for a moment, \nonly to be turned out the next ; and, as a permanent \nthing, residing in the open air. Nor did they lose much \nhereby ; in the cabin was no companionship ; socially, \nAhab was inaccessible. Though nominally included in \nthe census of Christendom, he was still an alien to it. \nHe lived in the world, as the last of the grizzly bears lived \nin settled Missouri. And as when spring and summer \nhad departed, that wild Logan of the woods, burying \nhimself in the hollow of a tree, lived out the winter there, \nsucking his own paws ; so, in his inclement, howling old \nage, Ahab's soul, shut up in the caved trunk of his body, \nthere fed upon the sullen paws of its gloom ! \n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXV \n\nTHE MAST-HEAD \n\nIT was during the more pleasant weather, that in due \nrotation with the other seamen my first mast-head came \nround. \n\nIn most American whalemen the mast-heads are \nmanned almost simultaneously with the vessel's leaving \nher port - r even though she may have fifteen thousand \nmiles, and more, to sail ere reaching her proper cruising- \nground. And if, after a three, four, or five years' voyage \nshe is drawing nigh home with anything empty in her \nsay, an empty vial even then her mast-heads are kept \nmanned to the last ; and not till her skysail-poles sail \nin among the spires of the port, does she altogether relin- \nquish the hope of capturing one whale more. \n\nNow, as the business of standing mast-heads, ashore or \nafloat, is a very ancient and interesting one, let us in some \nmeasure expatiate here. I take it, that the earliest \nstanders of mast-heads were the old Egyptians ; because, \nin all my researches, I find none prior to them. For \nthough their progenitors, the builders of Babel, must \ndoubtless, by their tower, have intended to rear the \nloftiest mast-head in all Asia, or Africa either ; yet (ere \nthe final truck was put to it) as that great stone mast of \ntheirs may be said to have gone by the board, in the dread \ngale of God's wrath ; therefore, we cannot give these \nBabel builders priority over the Egyptians. And that \nthe Egyptians were a nation of mast-head standers is \nan assertion based upon the general belief among archseo- \n\n191 \n\n\n\n192 MOBY-DICK \n\nlegists, that the first pyramids were founded for astro- \nnomical purposes : a theory singularly supported by the \npeculiar stair-like formation of all four sides of those \nedifices ; whereby, with prodigious long upliftings of their \nlegs, those old astronomers were wont to mount to the \napex, and sing out for new stars ; even as the look-outs \nof a modern ship sing out for a sail, or a whale just bearing \nin sight. In Saint Stylites, the famous Christian hermit \nof old times, who built him a lofty stone pillar in the \ndesert and spent the whole latter portion of his life on its \nsummit, hoisting his food from the ground with a tackle ; \nin him we have a remarkable instance of a dauntless \nstander of mast-heads ; who was not to be driven from \nhis place by fogs or frosts, rain, hail, or sleet ; but vali- \nantly facing everything out to the last, literally died at \nhis post. Of modern standers of mast-heads we have \nbut a lifeless set ; mere stone, iron, and bronze men ; who, \nthough well capable of facing out a stiff gale, are still \nentirely incompetent to the business of singing out upon \ndiscovering any strange sight. There is Napoleon ; who, \nupon the top of the column of Vendome, stands with arms \nfolded, some one hundred and fifty feet in the air ; care- \nless, now, who rules the decks below ; whether Louis- \nPhilippe, Louis Blanc, or Louis the Devil. Great \nWashington, too, stands high aloft on his towering main- \nmast in Baltimore, and like one of Hercules' pillars, his \ncolumn marks that point of human grandeur beyond which \nfew mortals will go. Admiral Nelson, also, on a capstan \nof gun-metal, stands his mast-head in Trafalgar Square ; \nand ever when most obscured by that London smoke, \ntoken is yet given that a hidden hero is there ; for where \nthere is smoke, must be fire. But neither great Washing- \nton, nor Napoleon, nor Nelson, will answer a single hail \nfrom below, however madly invoked to befriend by their \ncounsels the distracted decks upon which they gaze ; \n\n\n\nTHE MAST-HEAD 193 \n\nhowever it' may be surmised, that their spirits penetrate \nthrough the thick haze of the future, and descry what \nshoals and what rocks must be shunned. \n\nIt may seem unwarrantable to couple in any respect \nthe mast-head standers of the land with those of the sea ; \nbut that in truth it is not so, is plainly evinced by an item \nfor which Obed Macy, the sole historian of Nantucket, \nstands accountable. The worthy Obed tells us, that in \nthe early times of the whale-fishery, ere ships were regu- \nlarly launched in pursuit of the game, the people of that \nisland erected lofty spars along the sea-coast, to which \nthe look-outs ascended by means of nailed cleats, some- \nthing as fowls go upstairs in a hen-house. A few years \nago this same plan was adopted by the Bay whalemen of \nNew Zealand, who, upon descrying the game, gave notice \nto the ready-manned boats nigh the beach. But this \ncustom has now become obsolete ; turn we then to the \none proper mast-head, that of a whale-ship at sea. The \nthree mast-heads are kept manned from sunrise to sunset ; \nthe seamen taking their regular turns (as at the helm), \nand relieving each other every two hours. In the serene \nweather of the Tropics it is exceedingly pleasant the mast- \nhead ; nay, to a dreamy meditative man it is delightful. \nThere you stand, a hundred feet above the silent decks, \n; striding along the deep, as if the masts were gigantic \n; stilts, while beneath you and between your legs, as it \nwere, swim the hugest monsters of the sea, even as ships \nonce sailed between the boots of the famous Colossus at \nold Rhodes. There you stand, lost in the infinite series \nof the sea, with nothing ruffled but the waves. The \ntranced ship indolently rolls ; the drowsy trade winds \n;blow ; everything resolves you into languor. For the \nmost part, in this tropic whaling life, a sublime unevent- \nMness invests you ; you hear no news ; read no gazettes ; \n;)xtras with startling accounts of commonplaces never \nVOL. i. N \n\n\n\n194 MOBY-DICK \n\ndelude you into unnecessary excitements ; you hear of \nno domestic afflictions ; bankrupt securities ; fall of \nstocks ; are never troubled with the thought of what you \nshall have for dinner for all your meals for three years \nand more are snugly stowed in casks, and your bill of fare \nis immutable. \n\nIn one of those Southern whalemen, on a long three or \nfour years' voyage, as often happens, the sum of the various \nhours you spend at the mast-head would amount to several \nentire months. And it is much to be deplored that the \nplace to which you devote so considerable a portion of \nthe whole term of your natural life, should be so sadly \ndestitute of anything approaching to a cosy inhabitive- \nness, or adapted to breed a comfortable localness of feel- \ning, such as pertains to a bed, a hammock, a hearse, a \nsentry-box, a pulpit, a coach, or any other of those small \nand snug contrivances in which men temporarily isolate \nthemselves. Your most usual point of perch is the head \nof the t '-gallant-mast, where you stand upon two thin \nparallel sticks (almost peculiar to whalemen) called the \nt '-gallant-cross-trees. Here, tossed about by the sea, the \nbeginner feels about as cosy as he would standing on a \nbull's horns. To be sure, in cold weather you may carry \nyour house aloft with you, in the shape of a watch-coat ; \nbut properly speaking the thickest watch-coat is no more \nof a house than the unclad body ; for as the soul is glued \ninside of its fleshly tabernacle, and cannot freely move \nabout in it, nor even move out of it, without running great \nrisk of perishing (like an ignorant pilgrim crossing the \nsnowy Alps in winter) ; so a watch-coat is not so much \nof a house as it is a mere envelope, or additional skin \nencasing you. You cannot put a shelf or chest of drawers i \nin your body, and no more can you make a convenient \ncloset of your watch-coat. \n\nConcerning all this, it is much to be deplored that the \n\n\n\nTHE MAST-HEAD 195 \n\nmast-heads of a Southern whale -ship are unprovided \nwith those enviable little tents or pulpits, called crow's- \nnests, in which the look-outs of a Greenland whaler are \nprotected from the inclement weather of the frozen seas. \nIn the fireside narrative of Captain Sleet, entitled A \nVoyage among the Icebergs, in quest of the Greenland Whale, \nand incidentally for the re-discovery of the Lost Icelandic \nColonies of Old Greenland ; in this admirable volume, all \nstanders of mast-heads are furnished with a charmingly \ncircumstantial account of the then recently invented \ncrow's-nest of the Glacier, which was the name of Captain \nSleet's good craft. He called it the Sleet's crow's-nest, in \nhonour of himself ; he being the original inventor and \npatentee, and free from all ridiculous false delicacy, and \nholding that if we call our own children after our own \nnames (we fathers being the original inventors and \npatentees), so likewise should we denominate after our- \nselves any other apparatus we may beget. In shape, \nthe Sleet's crow's-nest is something like a large tierce or \npipe ; it is open above, however, where it is furnished \nwith a movable side -screen to keep to windward of your \nhead in a hard gale. Being fixed on the summit of the \nmast, you ascend into it through a little trap-hatch in \nthe bottom. On the after side, or side next the stern of \nthe ship, is a comfortable seat, with a locker underneath \nfor umbrellas, comforters, and coats. In front is a \nleather rack, hi which to keep your speaking trumpet, \npipe, telescope, and other nautical conveniences. When \nCaptain Sleet in person stood his mast-head hi this crow's- \nnest of his, he tells us that he always had a rifle with him \n(also fixed in the rack), together with a powder-flask and \nshot, for the purpose of popping off the stray narwhales, \nor vagrant sea-unicorns infesting those waters ; for you \ncannot successfully shoot at them from the deck owing to \nthe resistance of the water, but to shoot down upon them \n\n\n\n196 MOBY-DICK \n\nis a very different thing. Now, it was plainly a labour \nof love for Captain Sleet to describe, as he does, all the \nlittle detailed conveniences of his crow's-nest ; but though \nhe so enlarges upon many of these, and though he treats \nus to a very scientific account of his experiments in this \ncrow's-nest, with a small compass he kept there for the \npurpose of counteracting the errors resulting from what \nis called the ' local attraction ' of all binnacle magnets ; \nan error ascribable to the horizontal vicinity of the iron \nin the ship's planks, and in the Glacier's case, perhaps, to \nthere having been so many broken-down blacksmiths \namong her crew ; I say, that though the captain is very \ndiscreet and scientific here, yet, for all his learned ' bin- \nnacle deviations,' ' azimuth compass observations,' and \n' approximate errors,' he knows very well, Captain Sleet, \nthat he was not so much immersed in those profound \nmagnetic meditations, as to fail being attracted occasion- \nally toward that well-replenished little case-bottle, so \nnicely tucked in on one side of his crow's-nest, within \neasy reach of his hand. Though, upon the whole, I \ngreatly admire and even love the brave, the honest, and \nlearned captain ; yet I take it very ill of him that he \nshould so utterly ignore that case-bottle, seeing what a \nfaithful friend and comforter it must have been, while \nwith mittened fingers and hooded head he was studying \nthe mathematics aloft there in that bird's nest within \nthree or four perches of the pole. \n\nBut if we Southern whale -fishers are not so snugly \nhoused aloft as Captain Sleet and his Greenland men \nwere ; yet that disadvantage is greatly counterbalanced \nby the widely contrasting serenity of those seductive \nseas in which we South fishers mostly float. For one, I \nused to lounge up the rigging very leisurely, resting hi \nthe top to have a chat with Queequeg, or anyone else off \nduty whom I might find there ; then ascending a littl \n\n\n\nTHE MAST-HEAD 197 \n\nway further, and throwing a lazy leg over the topsail- \nyard, take a preliminary view of the watery pastures, \nand so at last mount to my ultimate destination. \n\nLet me make a clean breast of it here, and frankly \nadmit that I kept but sorry guard. With the problem \nof the universe revolving in me, how could I being left \ncompletely to myself at such a thought-engendering alti- \ntude, how could I but lightly hold my obligations to \nobserve all whale -ships' standing orders, ' Keep your \nweather-eye open, and sing out every time ' ? \n\nAnd let me in this place movingly admonish you, ye \nshipowners of Nantucket ! Beware of enlisting in your \nvigilant fisheries any lad with lean brow and hollow eye ; \ngiven to unseasonable meditativeness ; and who offers \nto ship with the Phsedon instead of Bowditch in his head. \nBeware of such an one, I say : your whales must be seen \nbefore they can be killed ; and this sunken-eyed young \nPlatonist will tow you ten wakes round the world, and \nnever make you one pint of sperm the richer. Nor are \nthese monitions at all unneeded. For nowadays, the \nwhale-fishery furnishes an asylum for many romantic, \nmelancholy, and absent-minded young men, disgusted \nwith the carking cares of earth, and seeking sentiment in \ntar and blubber. Childe Harold not unfrequently perches \nhimself upon the mast-head of some luckless disappointed \nwhale-ship, and in moody phrase ejaculates : \n\n1 Roll on, thou deep and dark blue ocean, roll ! \nTen thousand blubber-hunters sweep over thee in vain.' \n\nVery often do the captains of such ships take those \nabsent-minded young philosophers to task, upbraiding \nthem with not feeling sufficient ' interest ' in the voyage ; \nhalf -hinting that they are so hopelessly lost to all honour- \nable ambition, as that in their secret souls they would \nrather not see whales than otherwise. But all in vain ; \n\n\n\n198 MOBY-DICK \n\nthose young Platonists have a notion that their vision \nis imperfect ; they are short-sighted ; what use, then, to \nstrain the visual nerve ? They have left their opera- \nglasses at home. \n\n' Why, thou monkey, ' said a harpooneer to one of these \nlads, ' we 've been cruising now hard upon three years, \nand thou hast not raised a whale yet. Whales are scarce \nas hen's teeth whenever thou art up here.' Perhaps they \nwere ; or perhaps there might have been shoals of them \nin the far horizon ; but lulled into such an opium-like \nlistlessness of vacant, unconscious revery is this absent- \nminded youth by the blending cadence of waves with \nthoughts, that at last he loses his identity ; takes the \nmystic ocean at his feet for the visible image of that deep, \nblue, bottomless soul, pervading mankind and nature ; \nand every strange, half -seen, gliding, beautiful thing that \neludes him ; every dimly discovered, uprising fin of some \nundiscernible form, seems to him the embodiment of \nthose elusive thoughts that only people the soul by con- \ntinually flitting through it. In this enchanted mood, \nthy spirit ebbs away to whence it came ; becomes diffused \nthrough time and space ; like Cranmer's sprinkled Pan- \ntheistic ashes, forming at last a part of every shore the \nround globe over. \n\nThere is no life in thee, now, except that rocking life \nimparted by a gently rolling ship ; by her, borrowed from \nthe sea ; by the sea, from the inscrutable tides of God. \nBut while this sleep, this dream is on ye, move your foot \nor hand an inch ; slip your hold at all ; and your identity \ncomes back in horror. Over Descartian vortices you \nhover. And perhaps, at mid-day, in the fairest weather, \nwith one half-throttled shriek you drop through that \ntransparent air into the summer sea, no more to rise for- \never. Heed it well, ye Pantheists ! \n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVI \n\nTHE QUARTEK-DECK \n\n(Enter Ahab : Then all.) \n\nIT was not a great while after the affair of the pipe, that \none morning shortly after breakfast, Ahab, as was his \nwont, ascended the cabin-gangway to the deck. There \nmost sea-captains usually walk at that hour, as country \ngentlemen, after the same meal, take a few turns in \nthe garden. \n\nSoon his steady, ivory stride was heard, as to and fro \nhe paced his old rounds, upon planks so familiar to his \ntread, that they were all over dented, like geological \nstones, with the peculiar mark of his walk. Did you \nfixedly gaze, too, upon that ribbed and dented brow ; \nthere also, you would see still stranger footprints the \nfootprints of his one unsleeping, ever-pacing thought. \n\nBut on the occasion hi question, those dents looked \ndeeper, even as his nervous step that morning left a \ndeeper mark. And, so full of his thought was Ahab, that \nat every uniform turn that he made, now at the main- \nmast and now at the binnacle, you could almost see \nthat thought turn in him as he turned, and pace in him \nas he paced ; so completely possessing him, indeed, \nthat it all but seemed the inward mould of every outer \nmovement. \n\n' D' ye mark him, Flask ? ' whispered Stubb ; * the \nchick that 's in him pecks the shell. 'Twill soon be out.' \n\nThe hours wore on ; Ahab now shut up within his \n\n199 \n\n\n\n200 MOBY-DICK \n\ncabin ; anon, pacing the deck, with the same intense \nbigotry of purpose in his aspect. \n\nIt drew near the close of day. Suddenly he came to a \nhalt by the bulwarks, and inserting his bone leg into the \nauger-hole there, and with one hand grasping a shroud, \nhe ordered Starbuck to send everybody aft. \n\n' Sir ! ' said the mate, astonished at an order seldom \nor never given on shipboard except in some extraordinary \ncase. \n\n' Send everybody aft,' repeated Ahab. ' Mast-heads, \nthere ! come down ! ' \n\nWhen the entire ship's company were assembled, and \nwith curious and not wholly unapprehensive faces were \neyeing him, for he looked not unlike the weather horizon \nwhen a storm is coming up, Ahab, after rapidly glancing \nover the bulwarks, and then darting his eyes among the \ncrew, started from his standpoint ; and as though not a \nsoul were nigh him resumed his heavy turns upon the \ndeck. With bent head and half-slouched hat he con- \ntinued to pace, unmindful of the wondering whispering \namong the men ; till Stubb cautiously whispered to \nFlask, that Ahab must have summoned them there for \nthe purpose of witnessing a pedestrian feat. But this \ndid not last long. Vehemently pausing, he cried : \n\n' What do ye do when ye see a whale, men ? ' \n\n' Sing out for him ! ' was the impulsive rejoinder from \na score of clubbed voices. \n\n4 Good ! ' cried Ahab, with a wild approval in his tones ; \nobserving the hearty animation into which his unexpected \nquestion had so magnetically thrown them. \n\n' And what do ye next, men ? ' \n\n' Lower away, and after him ! ' \n\n' And what tune is it ye pull to, men ? ' \n\n' A dead whale or a stove boat ! ' \n\nMore and more strangely and fiercely glad and approv- \n\n\n\nTHE QUARTER-DECK 201 \n\ning grew the countenance of the old man at every \nshout ; while the mariners began to gaze curiously at \neach other, as if marvelling how it was that they them- \nselves became so excited at such seemingly purposeless \nquestions. \n\nBut, they were all eagerness again, as Ahab, now half- \nrevolving in his pivot -hole, with one hand reaching high \nup a shroud, and tightly, almost convulsively grasping \nit, addressed them thus : \n\n' All ye mast-headers have before now heard me give \norders about a white whale. Look ye ! d' ye see this \nSpanish ounce of gold*? ' holding up a broad bright \ncoin to the sun ' it is a sixteen-dollar piece, men. D' ye \nsee it ? Mr. Starbuck, hand me yon top-maul/ \n\nWhile the mate was getting the hammer, Ahab, without \nspeaking, was slowly rubbing the gold piece against the \nskirts of his jacket, as if to heighten its lustre, and without \nusing any words was meanwhile lowly humming to him- \nself, producing a sound so strangely muffled and inarticu- \nlate that it seemed the mechanical humming of the wheels \nof his vitality in him. \n\nReceiving the top-maul from Starbuck, he advanced \ntoward the mainmast with the hammer uplifted in one \nhand, exhibiting the gold with the other, and with a high \nraised voice exclaiming : ' Whosoever of ye raises me a \nwhite-headed whale with a wrinkled brow and a crooked \njaw ; whosoever of ye raises me that white-headed whale, \nwith three holes punctured in his starboard fluke look \nye, whosoever of ye raises me that same white whale, \nhe shall have this gold ounce, my boys ! ' \n\n' Huzza ! huzza ! ' cried the seamen, as with swinging \ntarpaulins they hailed the act of nailing the gold to \nthe mast. \n\n' It 's a white whale, I say,' resumed Ahab, as he threw \ndown the top-maul ; * a white whale. Skin your eyes \n\n\n\n202 MOBY-DICK \n\nfor him, men ; look sharp for white water ; if ye see but \na bubble, sing out.' \n\nAll this while Tashtego, Daggoo, and Queequeg had \nlooked on with even more intense interest and surprise \nthan the rest, and at the mention of the wrinkled brow \nand crooked jaw they had started as if each was separately \ntouched by some specific recollection. \n\n' Captain Ahab,' said Tashtego, ' that white whale must \nbe the same that some call Moby-Dick.' \n\n' Moby-Dick ? ' shouted Ahab. ' Do ye know the white \nwhale then, Tash ? ' \n\n' Does he fan-tail a little curious, sir, before he goes \ndown ? ' said the Gay-Header deliberately. \n\n' And has he a curious spout, too,' said Daggoo, ' very \nbushy, even for a parmacetty, and mighty quick, Captain \nAhab ? ' \n\n1 And he have one, two, tree oh ! good many iron \nin him hide, too, captain,' cried Queequeg disjointedly, \n\n4 all twiske-tee be-twisk, like him him ' faltering \n\nhard for a word, and screwing his hand round and round \nas though uncorking a bottle ' like him him ' \n\n' Cork-screw ! ' cried Ahab, ' ay, Queequeg, the har- \npoons lie all twisted and wrenched in him ; ay, Daggoo, \nhis spout is a big one, like a whole shock of wheat, and \nwhite as a pile of our Nantucket wool after the great \nannual sheep-shearing ; ay, Tashtego, and he fan-tails \nlike a split jib in a squall. Death and devils ! men, it is \nMoby-Dick ye have seen Moby-Dick Moby-Dick ! ' \n\n' Captain Ahab,' said Starbuck, who, with Stubb and \nFlask, had thus far been eyeing his superior with increasing \nsurprise, but at last seemed struck with a thought which \nsomewhat explained all the wonder. ' Captain Ahab, \nI have heard of Moby-Dick but it was not Moby-Dick \nthat took off thy leg ? ' \n\n' Who told thee that ? ' cried Ahab ; then pausing, \n\n\n\nTHE QUARTER-DECK 203 \n\n' Ay, Starbuck ; ay, my hearties all round ; it was \nMoby-Dick that dismasted me ; Moby-Dick that brought \nme to this dead stump I stand on now. Ay, ay,' he \nshouted, with a terrific, loud, animal sob, like that of a \nheart -stricken moose ; ' Ay, ay ! it was that accursed \nwhite whale that razeed me ; made a poor pegging lubber \nof me for ever and a day ! ' Then tossing both arms, \nwith measureless imprecations he shouted out : ' Ay, \nay ! and I '11 chase him round Good Hope, and round \nthe Horn, and round the Norway Maelstrom, and round \nperdition's flames before I give him up. And this is what \nye have shipped for, men ! to chase that white whale on \nboth sides of land, and over all sides of earth, till he spouts \nblack blood and rolls fin out. What say ye, men, will ye \nsplice hands on it, now ? I think ye do look brave/ \n\n* Ay, ay ! ' shouted the harpooneers and seamen, \nrunning closer to the excited old man : ' a sharp eye for \nthe White Whale ; a sharp lance for Moby-Dick ! ' \n\n' God bless ye,' he seemed to half sob and half shout. \n' God bless ye, men. Steward ! go draw the great \nmeasure of grog. But what 's this long face about, Mr. \nStarbuck ; wilt thou not chase the White Whale ? art not \ngame for Moby-Dick ? ' \n\n' I am game for his crooked jaw, and for the jaws of \nDeath too, Captain Ahab, if it fairly comes in the way of \nthe business we follow ; but I came here to hunt whales, \nnot my commander's vengeance. How many barrels \nwill thy vengeance yield thee even if thou gettest it, \nCaptain Ahab ? it will not fetch thee much in our Nan- \ntucket market.' \n\n' Nantucket market ! Hoot ! But come closer, Star- \nbuck ; thou requirest a little lower layer. If money 's \nto be the measurer, man, and the accountants have com- \nputed their great counting-house the globe, by girdling \nit with guineas, one to every three parts of an inch ; then, \n\n\n\n204 MOBY-DICK \n\nlet me tell thee, that my vengeance will fetch a great \npremium here ! ' \n\n' He smites his chest/ whispered Stubb, ' what 's that \nfor ? methinks it rings most vast, but hollow.' \n\n' Vengeance on a dumb brute ! ' cried Starbuck, ' that \nsimply smote thee from blindest instinct ! Madness ! \nTo be enraged with a dumb thing, Captain Ahab, seems \n\\ blapkemous.' \n\n' Hark ye yet again, the little lower layer. All visible \nobjects, man, are but as pasteboard masks. But in each \nevent in the living act, the undoubted deed there, some \nunknown but still reasoning thing puts forth the mouldings \nof its features from behind the unreasoning mask. If man \nwill strike, strike through the mask ! How can the prisoner \nreach outside except by thrusting through the wall ? To \nme, the White Whale is that wall, shoved near to me. \nSometimes I think there 's naught beyond. But 'tis \nenough. He tasks me ; he heaps me ; I see in him out- \nrageous strength, with an inscrutable malice sinewing it. \nThat inscrutable thing is chiefly what I hate ; and be the \nWhite Whale agent, or be the White Whale principal, I will \nwreak that hate upon him. Talk not to me of blasphemy, \nman ; I 'd strike the sun if it insulted me. For could the \nsun do that, then could I do the other ; since there is ever \na sort of fair play herein, jealousy presiding over all \ncreations. But not my master, man, is even that fair \nplay. Who 's over me ? Truth hath no confines. Take \noff thine eye ! more intolerable than fiends' glarings is a \ndoltish stare ! So, so ; thou reddenest and palest ; my \nheat has melted thee to anger-glow. But look ye, Star- \nbuck, what is said in heat, that thing unsays itself. There \nare men from whom warm words are small indignity. I \nmeant not to incense thee. Let it go. Look ! see yonder \nTurkish cheeks of spotted tawn living, breathing pictures \npainted by the sun. The pagan leopards the unrecking \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE QUARTER-DECK 205 \n\nand un worshipping things, that live ; and seek, and give \nno reasons for the torrid life they feel ! The crew, man, \nthe crew ! Are they not one and all with Ahab, in this \nmatter of the whale ? See Stubb ! he laughs ! See \nyonder Chilian ! he snorts to think of it. Stand up amid \nthe general hurricane, thy one tost sapling cannot, Star- \nbuck ! And what is it ? Reckon it. 'Tis but to help \nstrike a fin ; no wondrous feat for Starbuck. What is it \nmore ? From this one poor hunt, then, the best lance \nout of all Nantucket, surely he will not hang back, when \nevery foremast -hand has clutched a whetstone ? Ah ! \nconstrainings seize thee ; I see ! the billow lifts thee ! \nSpeak, but speak ! Ay, ay ! thy silence, then, that \nvoices thee. (Aside) Something shot from my dilated \nnostrils, he has inhaled it in his lungs. Starbuck now is \nmine ; cannot oppose me now, without rebellion.' \n\n4 God keep me ! keep us all ! ' murmured Starbuck \nlowly. \n\nBut in his joy at the enchanted, tacit acquiescence of the \nmate, Ahab did not hear his foreboding invocation ; nor \nyet the low laugh from the hold ; nor yet the presaging \nvibrations of the winds in the cordage ; nor yet the hollow \nflap of the sails against the masts, as for a moment their \nhearts sank in. For again Starbuck's downcast eyes \nlighted up with the stubbornness of life ; the subterranean \nlaugh died away ; the winds blew on ; the sails filled out ; \nthe ship heaved and rolled as before. Ah, ye admoni- \ntions and warnings ! why stay ye not when ye come ? \nBut rather are ye predictions than warnings, ye shadows ! \nYet not so much predictions from without, as verifications \nof the foregoing things within. For with little external \nto constrain us, the innermost necessities in our being, \nthese still drive us on. \n\n' The measure ! the measure ! ' cried Ahab. \n\nReceiving the brimming pewter, and turning to the \n\n\n\n206 MOBY-DICK \n\nharpooneers, he ordered them to produce their weapons. \nThen ranging them before him near the capstan, with \ntheir harpoons in their hands, while his three mates stood \nat his side with their lances, and the rest of the ship's \ncompany formed a circle round the group ; he stood for \nan instant searchingly eyeing every man of his crew. \nBut those wild eyes met his, as the bloodshot eyes of the \nprairie wolves meet the eye of their leader, ere he rushes \non at their head in the trail of the bison ; but, alas ! only \nto fall into the hidden snare of the Indian. \n\n* Drink and pass ! ' he cried, handing the heavy charged \n\nflagon to the nearest seaman. ' The crew alone now \n\ndrink. Round with it, round ! Short draughts long \n\nswallows, men ; 'tis hot as Satan's hoof. So, so ; it goes \n\nround excellently. It spiralises in ye ; forks out at the \n\nserpent -snapping eye. Well done ; almost drained. \n\nThat way it went, this way it comes. Hand it me \n\nj here 's a hollow ! Men, ye seem the years ; so brimming \n\n! life is gulped and gone. Steward, refill ! \n\n' Attend now, my braves. I have mustered ye all \nround this capstan ; and ye, mates, flank me with your \nlances ; and ye, harpooneers, stand there with your irons ; \nand ye, stout mariners, ring me in, that I may in some \nsort revive a noble custom of my fisherman fathers before \n\nme. men, you will yet see that Ha ! boy, come \n\nback ? bad pennies come not sooner. Hand it me. Why, \nnow, this pewter had run brimming again, wert not thou \nSt. Vitus' imp away, thou ague ! \n\n' Advance, ye mates ! Cross your lances full before me. \nWell done ! Let me touch the axis.' So saying, with \nextended arm, he grasped the three level, radiating lances \nat their crossed centre ; while so doing, suddenly and \nnervously twitched them ; meanwhile, glancing intently \nfrom Starbuck to Stubb, from Stubb to Flask. It \nseemed as though, by some nameless, interior volition, \n\n\n\nTHE QUARTER-DECK 207 \n\nhe would fain have shocked into them the same fiery \nemotion accumulated within the Leyden jar of his own \nmagnetic life. The three mates quailed before his strong, \nsustained, and mystic aspect. Stubb and Flask looked \nsideways from him ; the honest eye of Starbuck fell \ndownright. \n\n' In vain ! ' cried Ahab ; ' but, maybe, 'tis well. For \ndid ye three but once take the full-forced shock, then \nmine own electric thing, that had perhaps expired from \nout me. Perchance, too, it would have dropped ye dead. \nPerchance ye need it not. Down lances ! And now, ye \nmates, I do appoint ye three cup-bearers to my three \npagan kinsmen there yon three most honourable gentle- \nmen and noblemen, my valiant harpooneers. Disdain \nthe task ? What, when the great Pope washes the feet \nof beggars, using his tiara for ewer ? Oh, my sweet \ncardinals ! your own condescension, that shall bend ye \nto it. I do not order ye ; ye will it. Cut your seizings \nand draw the poles, ye harpooneers ! ' \n\nSilently obeying the order, the three harpooneers now \nstood with the detached iron part of their harpoons, some \nthree feet long, held, barbs up, before him. \n\n' Stab me not with that keen steel ! Cant them ; \ncant them over ! know ye not the goblet end ? Turn \nup the socket ! So, so ; now, ye cup-bearers, advance. \nThe irons ! take them ; hold them while I fill ! ' Forth- \nwith, slowly going from one officer to the other, he \nbrimmed the harpoon sockets with the fiery waters from \nthe pewter. \n\n' Now, three to three, ye stand. Commend the murder- \nous chalices ! Bestow them, ye who are now made \nparties to this indissoluble league. Ha ! Starbuck ! but \nthe deed is done ! Yon ratifying sun now waits to sit \nupon it. Drink, ye harpooneers ! drink and swear, ye \nmen that man the deathful whale-boat's bow Death to 1 \n\n\n\n208 MOBY-DICK \n\nMoby-Dick ! God hunt us all, if we do not hunt Moby- \nDick to his death ! ' The long, barbed steel goblets were \nlifted ; and to cries and maledictions against the White \nWhale, the spirits were simultaneously quaffed down with \na hiss. Starbuck paled, and turned, and shivered. Once \nmore, and finally, the replenished pewter went the rounds \namong the frantic crew ; when, waving his free hand to \nthem, they all dispersed ; and Ahab retired within his \ncabin. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVII \n\nSUNSET \n\n(The cabin ; by the stern windows ; Ahab sitting alone, \nand gazing out.) \n\nI LEAVE a white and turbid wake ; pale waters, paler \ncheeks, where'er I sail. The envious billows sidelong swell \nto whelm my track ; let them ; but first I pass. \n\nYonder, by the ever-brimming goblet's rim, the warm \nwaves blush like wine. The gold brow plumbs the blue. \nThe diver sun slow dived from noon, goes down ; my \nsoul mounts up ! she wearies with her endless hill. Is, \nthen, the crown too heavy that I wear ? this Iron Crown \nof Lombardy. Yet is it bright with many a gem ; I, the \nwearer, see not its far flashings ; but darkly feel that I \nwear that, that dazzlingly confounds. 'Tis iron that \nI know not gold. 'Tis split, too that I feel ; the \njagged edge galls me so, my brain seems to beat against \nthe solid metal ; ay, steel skull, mine ; the sort that \nneeds no helmet in the most brain-battering fight ! \n\nDry heat upon my brow ? Oh ! time was, when as \nthe sunrise nobly spurred me, so the sunset soothed. No \nmore. This lovely light, it lights not me ; all loveliness \nis anguish to me, since I can ne'er enjoy. Gifted with the \n\n\n\nhigh perception, I lack the low, enjoying power ; damned, \nmost subtly ana most malignantly ! damned in the midst , \nof Paradise ! Good night good night ! (Waving his ' \nhand, he moves from the window.) \n\n'Twas not so hard a task. I thought to find one stub- \n\nVOL. I. O \n\n\n\n\n\n\n210 MOBY-DICK \n\nborn, at the least ; but my one cogged circle fits into all \ntheir various wheels, and they revolve. Or, if you will, \nlike so many ant-hills of powder, they all stand before me ; \nand I their match. Oh, hard ! that to fire others, the \nmatch itself must needs be wasting ! What I Ve dared, \nI Ve willed ; and what I Ve willed, I '11 do ! They think \nme mad Starbuck does ; but I 'm demoniac, I am mad- \nness maddened ! That wild madness that 's only calm \nto comprehend itself ! The prophecy was that I should \nbe dismembered ; and Ay ! I lost this leg. I now \nprophesy that I will dismember my dismemberer. JJow* \nthen, be the prophet and the fulfiUer one. That 's more \nthan ye, ye great gods, ever were. I laugh and hoot at \nye, ye cricket -players, ye pugilists, ye deaf Burkes and \nblinded Bendigoes ! I will not say as schoolboys do to \nbullies, Take some one of your own size ; don't pommel \nme \\ No, ye Ve knocked me down, and I am up again ; \nbut ye have run and hidden. Come forth from behind \nyour cotton bags ! I have no long gun to reach ye. \nCome, Ahab's compliments to ye ; come and see if ye can \nswerve me. Swerve me ? ye cannot swerve me, else ye \nswerve yourselves ! man has ye there. Swerve me ? \nThe path to my fixed purpose is laid with iron rails, where - \non\" my soul is grooved to run. Over unsounded gorges, \nthrough the rifled hearts of mountains, under torrents' \nbeds, unerringly I rush ! Naught J s an obstacle, naught 's \nan angle to the iron way ! \n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVIII \n\nDUSK \n\n(By the mainmast ; Starbuck leaning against it.) \n\nMY soul is* more than matched ; she 's overmanned ; \nand by a madman ! Insufferable sting, that sanity should \nground arms on such a field ! But he drilled deep down, \nand blasted all my reason out of me ! I think I see his \nimpious end ; but feel that I must help him to it. Will I, \nnill I, the ineffable thing has tied me to him ; tows me \nwith a cable I have no knife to cut. Horrible old man ! \nWho 's over him, he cries ; ay, he would be a democrat \\^ \nto all above ; look, how he lords it over all below ! Oh ! \nI plainly see my miserable office, to obey, rebelling ; and \nworse yet, to hate with touch of pity ! For in his eyes I \nread some lurid woe would shrivel me up, had I it. Yet \nis there hope. Time and tide flow wide. The hated \nwhale has the round watery world to swim in, as the small \ngold-fish has its glassy globe. His heaven-insulting pur- \npose, God may wedge aside. I would up heart, were it \nnot like lead. But my whole clock 's run down ; my \nheart the all-controlling weight, I have no key to lift \nagain. \n\n(A burst of revelry from the forecastle.) \n\nOh, God ! to sail with such a heathen crew that have \nsmall touch of human mothers in them ! Whelped some- \nwhere by the sharkish sea. The White Whale is their \ndemigorgon. Hark ! the infernal orgies ! that revelry \nis forward ! mark the unfaltering silence aft ! Methinks \n\n211 \n\n\n\n212 \n\n\n\nMOBY-DICK \n\n\n\nit pictures life. Foremost through the sparkling sea \nshoots on the gay, embattled, bantering bow, but only to \ndrag dark Ahab after it, where he broods within his stern- \nward cabin, builded over the dead water of the wake, \nand further on, hunted by its wolfish gurglings. The long \nhowl thrills me through ! Peace ! ye revellers, and set \nthe watch ! Oh, life ! 'tis in an hour like this, with soul \nbeat down and held to knowledge, as wild, untutored \nthings are forced to feed Oh, life ! 'tis now that I do feel \nthe latent horror in thee ! but 'tis not me ! that horror 's \n\n\n\nout of me ! and with the soft feeling of ^ejiuman in me, \nyet ^will I try to fight ye, \"ye grim, phantom futures ! \nStand by me, hold me, bind me, ye blessed influences ! \n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIX \n\nFIRST NIGHT-WATCH \nFORE-TOP \n\n(Stubb solus, and mending a brace.) \n\nHA ! ha ! ha ! ha ! hem ! clear my throat ! I Ve been \nthinking over it ever since, and that ha, ha 3 s the final \nconsequence. Why so ? Because a laugh 's the wisest, \neasiest answer to all that 's queer ; and come what will, \none comfort 's always left that unfailing comfort is, it 's \nall predestinated. I heard not all his talk with Starbuck ; \nbut to my poor eye Starbuck then looked something as I \nthe other evening felt. Be sure the old Mogul has fixed \nhim, too. I twigged it, knew it ; had had the gift, might \nreadily have prophesied it for when I clapped my eye \nupon his skull I saw it. Well, Stubb, wise Stubb that 's \nmy title well, Stubb, what of it, Stubb ? Here 's a \ncarcase. I know not all that may be coming, but be it \nwhat it will, I '11 go to it laughing. Such a waggish \nleering as lurks in all your horribles ! I feel funny. Fa, \nla ! lirra, skirra ! What 's my juicy little pear at home \ndoing now ? Crying its eyes out ? Giving a party to the \nlast arrived harpooneers, I dare say, gay as a frigate's \npennant, and so am I fa, la ! lirra, skirra ! Oh \n\nWe '11 drink to-night with hearts as light, \n\nTo love, as gay and fleeting \nAs bubbles that swim, on the beaker's brim, \n\nAnd break on the lips while meeting. \n\nA brave stave that who calls ? Mr. Starbuck ? \nAy, ay, sir (Aside) he 's my superior, he has his too, \nif I 'm not mistaken. Ay, ay, sir, just through with this \njob coming. \n\n213 \n\n\n\nCHAPTER XL \n\nMIDNIGHT, FORECASTLE \nHABPOONEERS AND SAILORS \n\n(Foresail rises and discovers the match standing, lounging, \nleaning, and lying in various attitudes, all singing in chorus.) \n\nFarewell and adieu to you, Spanish ladies ! \nFarewell and adieu to you, ladies of Spain ! \nOur captain's commanded. \n\n1ST NANTUCKET SAILOE. \n\nOh, boys, don't be sentimental ; it 's bad for the \ndigestion !

Tumble up ! \n\nDUTCH SAILOR. \n\nGrand snoozing to-night, maty ; fat night for that. \nI mark this in our old Mogul's wine ; it 's quite as deaden- \ning to some as filliping to others. We sing ; they sleep- \nay, lie down there, like ground-tier butts. At 'em again ! \nThere, take this copper-pump, and hail 'em through it. \nTell 'em to avast dreaming of their lasses. Tell 'em it 's \nthe resurrection ; they must kiss their last, and come to \njudgment. That 's the way that 's it ; thy throat ain't \nspoiled with eating Amsterdam butter. \n\nFRENCH SAILOR. \n\nHist, boys ! let 's have a jig or two before we ride to \nanchor in Blanket Bay.

Now, boys ! \n\n(The half of them dance to the tambourine ; some go \nbelow ; some sleep or lie among the coils of rigging. Oaths \na-plenty.) \n\nAZORE SAILOR. \n\n(Dancing.) \n\nGo it, Pip !

I '11 dance over your grave, I will \nthat 's the bitterest threat of your night-women, that \nbeat head- winds round corners. O Christ ! to think of \nthe green navies and the green-skulled crews ! Well, \nwell ; belike the whole world 's a ball, as you scholars \nhave it ; and so 'tis right to make one ball-room of it. \nDance on, lads, you 're young ; I was once. \n\n3RD NANTUCKET SAILOR. \n\nSpell oh ! whew ! this is worse than pulling after \nwhales in a calm give us a whiff, Tash. \n\n(They cease dancing, and gather in clusters.

Now would all the \nwaves were women, then I 'd go drown, and chassee with \nthem evermore ! There 's naught so sweet on earth \nheaven may not match it ! as those swift glances of \nwarm, wild bosoms in the dance, when the over-arbour- \ning arms hide such ripe, bursting grapes. \n\nSICILIAN SAILOE. \n\n(Reclining.) \n\nTell me not of it ! Hark ye, lad fleet interfacings of \nthe limbs lithe swayings covings flutterings ! lip ! \nheart ! hip ! all graze : unceasing touch and go ! not \ntaste, observe ye, else come satiety. Eh, Pagan ? \n(Nudging.) \n\nTAHITIAN SAILOR. \n\n(Reclining on a mat.) \n\nHail, holy nakedness of our dancing girls ! the Heeva- \nHeeva ! Ah ! low-veiled, high-palmed Tahiti ! I still \nrest me on thy mat, but the soft soil has slid ! I saw \nthee woven in the wood, my mat ! green the first day I \nbrought ye thence ; now worn and wilted quite. Ah me ! \nnot thou nor I can bear the change ! How then, if so \nbe transplanted to yon sky ? Hear I the roaring streams \nfrom Pirohitee's peak of spears, when they leap down the \ncrags and drown the villages ? The blast ! the blast ! \nUp, spine, and meet it !

A wild, \nmystical, sympathetical feeling was in me ; Ahab's \nquenchless feud seemed mine. With greedy ears I \nlearned the history of that murderous monster against \nwhom I and all the others had taken our oaths of violence \nand revenge. \n\nFor some time past, though at intervals only, the un- \naccompanied, secluded White Whale had haunted those \nuncivilised seas mostly frequented by the sperm whale \nfishermen. But not all of them knew of his existence ; \nonly a few of them, comparatively, had knowingly seen \nhim ; while the number who as yet had actually and \nknowingly given battle to him, was small indeed. For, \nowing to the large number of whale-cruisers ; the dis- \norderly way they were sprinkled over the entire watery \ncircumference, many of them adventurously pushing \ntheir quest along solitary latitudes, so as seldom or never \nfor a whole twelvemonth or more on a stretch, to en- \ncounter a single news-telling sail of any sort ; the inordin- \nate length of each separate voyage ; the irregularity of the \ntimes of sailing from home ; all these, with other circum- \nstances, direct and indirect, long obstructed the spread \nthrough the whole world- wide whaling-fleet of the special \nindividualising tidings concerning Moby-Dick. It was \n\n222 \n\n\n\nMOBY-DICK 223 \n\nhardly to be doubted, that several vessels reported to have \nencountered, at such or such a time, or on such or such a \nmeridian, a sperm whale of uncommon magnitude and \nmalignity, which whale, after doing great mischief to his \nassailants, had completely escaped them ; to some minds \nit was not an* unfair presumption, I say, that the whale \nin question must have been no other than Moby-Dick. \nYet as of late the sperm whale fishery had been marked \nby various and not unfrequent instances of great ferocity, \ncunning, and malice in the monster attacked ; therefore \nit was, that those who by accident ignorantly gave battle \nto Moby-Dick ; such hunters, perhaps, for the most part, \nwere content to ascribe the peculiar terror he bred, more, \nas it were, to the perils of the sperm whale fishery at \nlarge, than to the individual cause. In that way, mostly, \nthe disastrous encounter between Ahab and the whale \nhad hitherto been popularly regarded. \n\nAnd as for those who, previously hearing of the White \nWhale, by chance caught sight of him ; in the beginning \nof the thing they had every one of them, almost, as boldly \nand fearlessly lowered for him, as for any other whale of \nthat species. But at length, such calamities did ensue \nin these assaults not restricted to sprained wrists and \nankles, broken limbs, or devouring amputations but \nfatal to the last degree of fatality ; those repeated disas- \ntrous repulses, all accumulating and piling their terrors \nupon Moby -Dick ; those things had gone far to shake the \nfortitude of many brave hunters, to whom the story of \nthe White Whale had eventually come. \n\nNor did wild rumours of all sorts fail to exaggerate, and \nstill the more horrify the true histories of these deadly \nencounters. For not only do fabulous rumours naturally \ngrow out of the very body of all surprising terrible events, \nas the smitten tree gives birth to its fungi ; but, in \nmaritime life, far more than in that of terra-firma, wild \n\n\n\n224 MOBY-DICK \n\nrumours abound, wherever there is any adequate reality \nfor them to cling to. And as the sea surpasses the land \nin this matter, so the whale-fishery surpasses every other \nsort of maritime life, in the wonderfulness and fearful- \nness of the rumours which sometimes circulate there. \nFor not only are whalemen as a body unexempt from that \nignorance and superstitiousness hereditary to all sailors ; \nbut of all sailors, they are by all odds the most directly \nbrought into contact with whatever is appallingly astonish- \ning in the sea ; face to face they not only eye its greatest \nmarvels, but, hand to jaw, give battle to them. Alone, \nin such remotest waters, that though you sailed a thousand \nmiles, and passed a thousand shores, you would not come \nto any chiselled hearthstone, or aught hospitable beneath \nthat part of the sun ; in such latitudes and longitudes, \npursuing too such a calling as he does, the whaleman is \nwrapped by influences all tending to make his fancy \npregnant with many a mighty birth. \n\nNo wonder, then, that ever gathering volume from the \nmere transit over the wildest watery spaces, the outblown \nrumours of the White Whale did in the end incorporate \nwith themselves all manner of morbid hints, and half- \nformed foetal suggestions of supernatural agencies, which \neventually invested Moby-Dick with new terrors un- \nborrowed from anything that visibly appears. So that in \nmany cases such a panic did he finally strike, that few \nwho by those rumours, at least, had heard of the White \nWhale, few of those hunters were willing to encounter the \nperils of his jaw. \n\nBut there were still other and more vital practical \ninfluences at work. Not even at the present day has the \noriginal prestige of the sperm whale, as fearfully dis- \ntinguished from all other species of the leviathan, died out \nof the minds of the whalemen as a body. There are those \nthis day among them, who, though intelligent and cour- \n\n\n\nMOBY-DICK 225 \n\nageous enough in offering battle to the Greenland or right \nwhale, would perhaps, either from professional inexperi- \nence, or incompetency, or timidity, decline a contest with \nthe sperm whale ; at any rate, there are plenty of whale- \nmen, especially among those whaling nations not sailing \nunder the American flag, who have never hostilely en- \ncountered the sperm whale, but whose sole knowledge \nof the leviathan is restricted to the ignoble monster \nprimitively pursued in the North ; seated on their \nhatches, these men will hearken with a childish fireside \ninterest and awe, to the wild, strange tales of Southern \nwhaling. Nor is the pre-eminent tremendousness of the \ngreat sperm whale anywhere more feelingly compre- \nhended, than on board of those prows which stem him. \n\nAnd as if the now tested reality of his might had in \nformer legendary times thrown its shadow before it ; we \nfind some book naturalists Olassen and Povelson \ndeclaring the sperm whale not only to be a consternation \nto every other creature in the sea, but also to be so in- \ncredibly ferocious as continually to be athirst for human \\ \nblood. Nor even down to so late a time as Cuvier's, were \nthese or almost similar impressions effaced. For in his \nNatural History, the Baron himself affirms that at \nsight of the sperm whale, all fish (sharks included) are \n'struck with the most lively terrors,' and 'often in the \nprecipitancy of their flight dash themselves against the \nrocks with such violence as to cause instantaneous death.' \nAnd however the general experiences in the fishery may \namend such reports as these ; yet in their full terribleness, \neven to the bloodthirsty item of Povelson, the super- \nstitious belief in them is, in some vicissitudes of their \nvocation, revived in the minds of the hunters. \n\nSo that overawed by the rumours and portents concern- \ning him, not a few of the fishermen recalled, in reference \nto Moby-Dick, the earlier days of the sperm whale fishery, \n\nVOL. i. p \n\n\n\n226 MOBY-DICK \n\nwhen it was oftentimes hard to induce long -practised right \nwhalemen to embark in the perils of this new and daring \nwarfare ; such men protesting that although other \nleviathans might be hopefully pursued, yet to chase and \npoint lance at such an apparition as the sperm whale was \nnot for mortal man. That to attempt it, would be inevit- \nably to be torn into a quick eternity. On this head, \nthere are some remarkable documents that may be \nconsulted. \n\nNevertheless, some there were, who even in the face of \nthese things were ready to give chase to Moby-Dick ; and \na still greater number who, chancing only to hear of him \ndistantly and vaguely, without the specific details of any \ncertain calamity, and without superstitious accompani- \nments, were sufficiently hardy not to flee from the battle \nif offered. \n\nOne of the wild suggestings referred to, as at last coming \nto be linked with the White Whale in the minds of the \nsuperstitiously inclined, was the unearthly conceit that \nMoby-Dick was ubiquitous ; that he had actually been \nencountered in opposite latitudes at one and the same \ninstant of time. \n\nNor, credulous as such minds must have been, was \nthis conceit altogether without some faint show of super- \nstitious probability. For as the secrets of the currents \nin the seas have never yet been divulged, even to the \nmost erudite research ; so the hidden ways of the sperm \nwhale when beneath the surface remain, in great part, \nunaccountable to his pursuers ; and from time to time \nhave originated the most curious and contradictory specu- \nlations regarding them, especially concerning the mystic \nmodes whereby, after sounding to a great depth, he trans- \nports himself with such vast swiftness to the most widely \ndistant points. \n\nIt is a thing well known to both American and English \n\n\n\nMOBY-DICK 227 \n\nwhale-ships, and as well a thing placed upon authoritative \nrecord years ago by Scoresby, that some whales have been \ncaptured far north in the Pacific, in whose bodies have been \nfound the barbs of harpoons darted in the Greenland seas. \nNor is it to be gainsaid, that in some of these instances it \nhas been declared that the interval of time between the \ntwo assaults could not have exceeded very many days. \nHence, by inference, it has been believed by some whale- \nmen, that the Nor'- West Passage, so long a problem to \nman, was never a problem to the whale. So that here, \nin the real living experience of living men, the prodigies \nrelated in old times of the inland Strello mountain in \nPortugal (near whose top there was said to be a lake in \nwhich the wrecks of ships floated up to the surface) ; \nand that still more wonderful story of the Arethusa \nfountain near Syracuse (whose waters were believed to \nhave come from the Holy Land by an underground \npassage) ; these fabulous narrations are almost fully \nequalled by the realities of the whaleman. \n\nForced into familiarity, then, with such prodigies as \nthese ; and knowing that after repeated, intrepid assaults, \nthe White Whale had escaped alive ; it cannot be much \nmatter of surprise that some whalemen should go still \nfurther in their superstitions ; declaring Moby-Dick not \nonly ubiquitous, but immortal (for immortality is but \nubiquity in time) ; that though groves of spears should \nbe planted in his flanks, he would still swim away un- \nharmed ; or if indeed he should ever be made to spout \nthick blood, such a sight would be but a ghastly decep- \ntion ; for again in unensanguined billows hundreds of \nleagues away, his unsullied jet would once more be seen. \n\nBut even stripped of these supernatural surmisings, \nthere was enough in the earthly make and incontestable \ncharacter of the monster to strike the imagination with \nunwonted power. For, it was not so much his uncommon \n\n\n\n228 MOBY-DICK \n\nbulk that so much distinguished him from other sperm \nwhales, but, as was elsewhere thrown out a peculiar \nsnow-white wrinkled forehead, and a high, pyramidical \nwhite hump. These were his prominent features ; the \ntokens whereby, even hi the limitless, uncharted seas, \nhe revealed his identity, at a long distance, to those who \nknew him. \n\nThe rest of his body was so streaked, and spotted, and \nmarbled with the same shrouded hue, that, in the end, \nhe had gained his distinctive appellation of the White \nWhale ; a name, indeed, literally justified by his vivid \naspect, when seen gliding at high noon through a dark \nblue sea, leaving a milky-way wake of creamy foam, all \nspangled with golden gleamings. \n\nNor was it his unwonted magnitude, nor his remarkable \nhue, nor yet his deformed lower jaw, that so much in- \nvested the whale with natural terror, as that unexampled, \nintelligent malignity which, according to specific accounts, \nhe had over and over again evinced in his assaults. More \nthan all, his treacherous retreats struck more of dismay \nthan perhaps aught else. For, when swimming before \nhis exulting pursuers, with every apparent symptom of \nalarm, he had several times been known to turn round \nsuddenly, and, bearing down upon them, either stave \ntheir boats to splinters, or drive them back in consterna- \ntion to their ship. \n\nAlready several fatalities had attended his chase. \nBut though similar disasters, however little bruited \nashore, were by no means unusual in the fishery ; yet, in \nmost instances, such seemed the White Whale's infernal \naforethought of ferocity, that every dismembering or \ndeath that he caused, was not wholly regarded as having \nbeen inflicted by an unintelligent agent. \n\nJudge, then, to what pitches of inflamed, distracted \nfury the minds of his more desperate hunters were im- \n\n\n\nMOBY-DICK 229 \n\npelled, when amid the chips of chewed boats, and the \nsinking limbs of torn comrades, they swam out of the \nwhite curds of the whale's direful wrath into the serene, \nexasperating sunlight, that smiled on, as if at a birth or \na bridal. \n\nHis three boats stove around him, and oars and men \nboth whirling in the eddies, one captain, seizing the line- \nknife from his broken prow, had dashed at the whale, \nas an Arkansas duellist at his foe, blindly seeking with a \nsix-inch blade to reach the fathom-deep life of the whale. \nThat captain was Ahab. And then it was, that suddenly \nsweeping his sickle -shaped lower jaw beneath him, Moby- \nDick had reaped away Ahab's leg, as a mower a blade of \ngrass in the field. No turbaned Turk, no hired Venetian \nor Malay, could have smote him with more seeming \nmalice. Small reason was there to doubt, then, that ever \nsince that almost fatal encounter, Ahab had cherished a \nwild vindictiveness against the whale, all the more fell \nfor that in his frantic morbidness he at last came to \nidentify with him, not only all his bodily woes, but all \nhis intellectual and spiritual exasperations. The White \nWhale swam before him as the monomaniac incarnation \nof all those malicious agencies which some deep men \nfeel eating in them, till they are left living on with half \na heart and half a lung. That intangible malignity which \nhas been from the beginning ; to whose dominion even \nthe modern Christians ascribe one-half of the worlds ; \nwhich the ancient Ophites of the East reverenced in their \nstatue devil ; Ahab did not fall down and worship it \nlike them ; but deliriously transferring its idea to the \nabhorred White Whale, he pitted himself, all mutilated, \nagainst it. All that most maddens and torments ; all \nthat stirs up the lees of things ; all truth with malice in \nit ; all that cracks the sinews and cakes the brain ; all \nthe subtle demonisms of life and thought ; all evil, to \n\n\n\n230 MOBY-DICK \n\ncrazy Ahab, were visibly personified, and made practically \nassailable in Moby-Dick. He piled upon the whale's \nwhite hump the sum of all the general rage and hate felt \nby his whole race from Adam down ; and then, as if his \nchest had been a mortar, he burst his hot heart's shell \nupon it. \n\nIt is not probable that this monomania in him took its \ninstant rise at the precise time of his bodily dismember- \nment. Then, in darting at the monster, knife in hand, \nhe had but given loose to a sudden, passionate, corporal \nanimosity ; and when he received the stroke that tore \nhim, he probably but felt the agonising bodily laceration, \nbut nothing more. Yet, when by this collision forced to \nturn toward home, and for long months of days and weeks, \nAhab and anguish lay stretched together in one ham- \nmock, rounding in mid- winter that dreary, howling Pata- \ngonian Cape ; then it was, that his torn body and gashed \nsoul bled into one another ; and so interfusing, made him \nmad. That it was only then, on the homeward voyage, \nafter the encounter, that the final monomania seized him, \nseems all but certain from the fact that, at intervals during \nthe passage, he was a raving lunatic ; and, though un- \nlimbed of a leg, yet such vital strength yet lurked in his \nEgyptian chest, and was moreover intensified by his \ndelirium, that his mates were forced to lace him fast, \neven there, as he sailed, raving in his hammock. In a \nstrait -jacket, he swung to the mad rockings of the gales. \nAnd, when running into more sufferable latitudes, the \nship, with mild stun '-sails spread, floated across the \ntranquil tropics, and, to all appearances, the old man's \ndelirium seemed left behind him with the Cape Horn \nswells, and he came forth from his dark den into the blessed \nlight and air ; even then, when he bore that firm, collected \nfront, however pale, and issued his calm orders once again ; \nand his mates thanked God the direful madness was now \n\n\n\nMOBY-DICK 231 \n\ngone ; even then, Ahab, in his hidden self, raved on. \nHuman madness is oftentimes a cunning and most feline \nthing. When you think it fled, it may have but become \ntransfigured into some still subtler form. Ahab's full \nlunacy subsided not, but deepeningly contracted ; like \nthe unabated Hudson, when that noble Northman flows \nnarrowly, but unfathomably through the Highland gorge. \nBut, as in his narrow-flowing monomania, not one jot \nof Ahab's broad madness had been left behind ; so in \nthat broad madness, not one jot of his great natural \nintellect had perished. That before living agent, now \nbecame the living instrument. If such a furious trope \nmay stand, his special lunacy stormed his general sanity, \nand carried it, and turned all its concentrated cannon \nupon its own mad mark ; so that far from having lost \nhis strength, Ahab, to that one end, did now possess a \nthousand-fold more potency than ever he had sanely \nbrought to bear upon any one reasonable object. \n\nThis is much ; yet Ahab's larger, darker, deeper part \nremains unhinted. But vain to popularise profundities, \nand all truth is profound. Winding far down from within \nthe very heart of this spiked Hotel de Cluny where we \nhere stand however grand and wonderful, now quit it ; \nand take your way, ye nobler, sadder souls, to those vast \nRoman halls of Thermes ; where far beneath the fantastic \ntowers of man's upper earth, his root of grandeur, his \nwhole awful essence sits in bearded state ; an antique \nburied beneath antiquities, and throned on torsoes ! \nSo with a broken throne, the great gods mock that captive \nking ; so like a Caryatid, he patient sits, upholding on \nhis frozen brow the piled entablatures of ages. Wind ye \ndown there, ye prouder, sadder souls ! question that \nproud, sad king ! A family likeness ! ay, he did beget \nye\u003e ye young exiled royalties ; and from your grim sire \nonly will the old State -secret come. \n\n\n\n232 MOBY-DICK \n\nNow, in his heart, Ahab had some glimpse of this, \nnamely : all my means are sane, my motive and my object \nmad. Yet without power to kill, or change, or shun the \nfact, he likewise knew that to mankind he did long dis- \n. semble ; in some sort, did still. But that thing of his \ndissembling was only subject to his perceptibility, not \nto his will determinate. Nevertheless, so well did he \nsucceed in that dissembling, that when with ivory leg \nhe stepped ashore at last, no Nantucketer thought him \notherwise than but naturally grieved, and that to the \nquick, with the terrible casualty which had overtaken \nhim. \n\nThe report of his undeniable delirium at sea was like- \nwise popularly ascribed to a kindred cause. And so too, \nall the added moodiness which always afterward, to the \nvery day of sailing in the Pequod on the present voyage, \nsat brooding on his brow. Nor is it so very unlikely, \nthat far from distrusting his fitness for another whaling \nvoyage, on account of such dark symptoms, the calculating \npeople of that prudent isle were inclined to harbour the \nconceit, that for those very reasons he was all the better \nqualified and set on edge, for a pursuit so full of rage and \nwildness as the bloody hunt of whales. Gnawed within \nand scorched without, with the unfixed, unrelenting fangs \nof some incurable idea ; such an one, could he be found, \nwould seem the very man to dart his iron and lift his \nlance against the most appalling of all brutes. Or, if for \nany reason thought to be corporeally incapacitated for \nthat, yet such an one would seem superlatively competent \nto cheer and howl on his underlings to the attack. But \nbe all this as it may, certain it is, that with the mad \nsecret of his unabated rage bolted up and keyed in him, \nAhab had purposely sailed upon the present voyage with \nthe one only and all-engrossing object of hunting the White \nWhale. Had any one of his old acquaintances on shore \n\n\n\nMOBY-DICK 233 \n\nbut half dreamed of what was lurking in him then, how \nsoon would their aghast and righteous souls have wrenched \nthe ship from such a fiendish man ! They were bent \non profitable cruises, the profit to be counted down in \ndollars from the mint. He was intent on an audacious, \nimmitigable, and supernatural revenge. \n\nHere, then, was this gray-headed, ungodly old man, \nchasing with curses a Job's whale round the world, at the \nhead of a crew, too, chiefly made up of mongrel renegades, \nand castaways, and cannibals morally enfeebled, also, \nby the incompetence of mere unaided virtue or right- \nmindedness mStarbuck, the invulnerable jollity of indiffer- \nence and recklessness in Stubb, and the pervading medioc- \nrity in Flask. Such a crew, so officered, seemed specially \npicked and packed by some infernal fatality to help Mm \nto his monomaniac revenge. How it was that they so \naboundingly responded to the old man's ire by what \nevil magic their souls were possessed, that at times his \nhate seemed almost theirs ; the White Whale as much \ntheir insufferable foe as his ; how all this came to be- \nwhat the White Whale was to them, or how to their \nunconscious understandings, also, in some dim, unsus- \npected way, he might have seemed the gliding great demon \nof the seas of life, all this to explain, would be to dive \ndeeper than Ishmael can go. The subterranean miner \nthat works in us all, how can one tell whither leads his \nshaft by the ever shifting, muffled sound of his pick ? \nWho does not feel the irresistible arm drag ? What skiff \nin tow of a seventy-four can stand still ? For one, I gave \nmyself up to the abandonment of the time and the place ; \nbut while yet all a-rush to encounter the whale, could see \nnaught in that brute but the deadliest ill. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLII \n\nTHE WHITENESS OF THE WHALE \n\nWHAT the White Whale was to Ahab has been hinted ; \nwhat, at times, he was to me, as yet remains unsaid. \n\nAside from those more obvious considerations touching \nMoby-Dick, which could not but occasionally awaken in \nany man's soul some alarm, there was another thought, \nor rather vague, nameless horror concerning him, which \nat times by its intensity completely overpowered all the \nrest ; and yet so mystical and well-nigh ineffable was it, \nthat I almost despair of putting it in a comprehensible \nform. It was the whiteness of the whale that above all \nthings appalled me. But how can I hope to explain \nmyself here ; and yet, in some dim, random way, explain \nmyself I must, else all these chapters might be naught. \n\nThough in many natural objects, whiteness refiningly \nenhances beauty, as if imparting some special virtue of \nits own, as in marbles, japonicas, and pearls ; and though \nvarious nations have in some way recognised a certain \nroyal pre-eminence in this hue ; even the barbaric, grand \nold kings of Pegu placing the title ' Lord of the White \nElephants ' above all their other magniloquent ascrip- \ntions of dominion ; and the modern kings of Siam un- \nfurling the same snow-white quadruped in the royal \nstandard ; and the Hanoverian flag bearing the one figure \nof a snow-white charger ; and the great Austrian Empire, \nCaesarian, heir to overlording Rome, having for the \nimperial colour the same imperial hue ; and though this \npre-eminence in it applies to the human race itself, giving \n\n234 \n\n\n\nTHE WHITENESS OF THE WHALE 235 \n\nthe white man ideal mastership over every dusky tribe ; \nand though, besides all this, whiteness has been even \nmade significant of gladness, for among the Romans a \nwhite stone marked a joyful day ; and though in other \nmortal sympathies and symbolisings, this same hue is \nmade the emblem of many touching, noble things the \ninnocence of brides, the benignity of age ; though among \nthe Bed Men of America the giving of the white belt of \nwampum was the deepest pledge of honour ; though in \nmany climes, whiteness typifies the majesty of Justice \nin the ermine of the Judge, and contributes to the daily \nstate of kings and queens drawn by milk-white steeds ; \nthough even in the higher mysteries of the most august \nreligions it has been made the symbol of the divine spot- \nlessness and power ; by the Persian fire -worshippers, the \nwhite forked flame being held the holiest on the altar ; \nand in the Greek mythologies, Great Jove himself being \nmade incarnate in a snow-white bull ; and though to the \nnoble Iroquois, the mid-winter sacrifice of the sacred \nWhite Dog was by far the holiest festival of their theology, \nthat spotless, faithful creature being held the purest \nenvoy they could send to the Great Spirit with the annual \ntidings of their own fidelity ; and though directly from \nthe Latin word for white, all Christian priests derive the \nname of one part of their sacred vesture, the alb or tunic, \nworn beneath the cassock ; and though among the holy \npomps of the Romish faith, white is specially employed \nin the celebration of the Passion of our Lord ; though \nin the Vision of St. John, white robes are given to the \nredeemed, and the four-and-twenty elders stand clothed \nin white before the great white throne, and the Holy \nOne that sitteth there white like wool ; yet for all these \naccumulated associations, with whatever is sweet, and \nhonourable, and sublime, there yet lurks an elusive some- \nthing in the innermost idea of this hue, which strikes more \n\n\n\n~ \n\n\n\n236 MOBY-DICK \n\nof panic to the soul than that redness which affrights in \nblood. \n\nThis elusive quality it is, which causes the thought of \nwhiteness, when divorced from more kindly associations, \nand coupled with any object terrible in itself, to heighten \nthat terror to the furthest bounds. Witness the white \nbear of the Poles, and the white shark of the Tropics ; \nwhat but their smooth, flaky whiteness makes them the \ntranscendent horrors they are ? That ghastly whiteness \nit is which imparts such an abhorrent mildness, even more \nloathsome than terrific, to the dumb gloating of their \naspect. So that not the fierce-fanged tiger in his heraldic \ncoat can so stagger courage as the white-shrouded bear \nor shark. 1 \n\nBethink thee of the albatross, whence come those \nclouds of spiritual wonderment and pale dread, in which \nthat white phantom sails in all imaginations ? Not \nColeridge first threw that spell ; but God's great, unflatter- \ning laureate, Nature. 2 \n\n1 With reference to the Polar bear, it may possibly be urged by him \nwho would fain go still deeper into this matter, that it is not the white- \nness, separately regarded, which heightens the intolerable hideousness of \nthat brute ; for, analysed, that heightened hideousness, it might be said, \nonly arises from the circumstance, that the irresponsible ferociousness of \nthe creature stands invested in the fleece of celestial innocence and love : \nand hence, by bringing together two such opposite emotions in our minds, \nthe Polar bear frightens us with so unnatural a contrast. But even \nassuming all this to be true ; yet, were it not for the whiteness, you \nwould not have that intensified terror. \n\nAs for the white shark, the white gliding ghostliness of repose in that \ncreature, when beheld in his ordinary moods, strangely tallies with the \nsame quality in the Polar quadruped. This peculiarity is most vividly \nhit by the French in the name they bestow upon that fish. The Romish \nmass for the dead begins with * Requiem eternam ' (eternal rest), whence \nRequiem denominating the mass itself, and any other funereal music. \nNow, in allusion to the white, silent stillness of death in this shark, and \nthe mild deadliness of his habits, the French call him Requin. \n\n2 I remember the first albatross I ever saw. It was during a prolonged \ngale, in waters hard upon the Antarctic seas. From my forenoon watch \nbelow, I ascended to the overclouded deck ; and there, dashed upon the \nmain hatches, I saw a regal, feathery thing of unspotted whiteness, and \nwith a hooked, Roman bill sublime. At intervals, it arched forth its vast \n\n\n\nTHE WHITENESS OF THE WHALE 237 \n\nMost famous in our Western annals and Indian tradi- \ntions is that of the White Steed of the Prairies ; a \nmagnificent milk-white charger, large -eyed, small-headed, \nbluff-chested, and with the dignity of a thousand monarchs \nin his lofty, over-scorning carriage. He was the elected \nXerxes of vast herds of wild horses, whose pastures in \nthose days were only fenced by the Rocky Mountains \nand the Alleghanies. At their flaming head he westward \ntrooped it like that chosen star which every evening leads \non the hosts of light. The flashing cascade of his mane, \nthe curving comet of his tail, invested him with housings \nmore resplendent than gold and silver beaters could have \nfurnished him. A most imperial and archangelical appari- \ntion of that unf alien, Western world, which to the eyes of \n\n\n\narchangel wings, as if to embrace some holy ark. Wondrous flutterings \nand throbbings shook it. Though bodily unharmed, it uttered cries, as \nsome king's ghost in supernatural distress. Through its inexpressible, \nstrange eyes, methought I peeped to secrets which took hold of God. As \n\n\n\nstrange eyes, metnougnt l peeped to secrets wnicn toofc hold 01 l*od. As I \nAbraham before the angels, I bowed myself ; the white thing was so white, 1 \nits wings so wide, and in those forever exiled waters, I had lost the * \nmiserable warping memories of traditions and of towns. Long I gazed at \nthat prodigy of plumage. I cannot tell, can only hint, the things that \ndarted through me then. But at last I awoke ; and turning, asked a \nsailor what bird was this. A goney, he replied. Goney ! I never had \nheard that name before ; is it conceivable that this glorious thing ia \nutterly unknown to men ashore ! never ! But some time after, I learned \nthat goney was some seaman's name for albatross. So that by no possi- \nbility could Coleridge's wild Rhyme have had aught to do with those \nmystical impressions which were mine, when I saw that bird upon our \ndeck. For neither had I then read the Rhyme, nor knew the bird to be \nan albatross. Yet, in saying this, I do but indirectly burnish a little \nbrighter the noble merit of the poem and the poet. \n\nI assert, then, that in the wondrous bodily whiteness of the bird chiefly \nlurks the secret of the spell ; a truth the more evinced in this, that by a \nsolecism of terms there are birds called gray albatrosses ; and these I have \nfrequently seen, but never with such emotions as when I beheld the \nAntarctic fowl. \n\nBut how had the mystic thing been caught? Whisper it not, and I \nwill tell ; with a treacherous hook and line, as the fowl floated on the sea. \nAt last the captain made a postman of it ; tying a lettered, leathern tally \nround its neck, with the ship's time and place ; and then letting it \nescape. But I doubt not, that leathern tally, meant for man, was taken \noff in Heaven, when the white fowl flew to join the wing-folding, the \ninvoking, and adoring cherubim ! \n\n\n\n238 MOBY-DICK \n\nthe old trappers and hunters revived the glories of those \nprimeval times when Adam walked majestic as a god, \nbluff -bo wed and fearless as this mighty steed. Whether \nmarching amid his aides and marshals in the van of \ncountless cohorts that endlessly streamed it over the \nplains, like an Ohio ; or whether with his circumambient \nsubjects browsing all around at the horizon, the White \nSteed gallopingly reviewed them with warm nostrils \nreddening through his cool milkiness ; in whatever aspect \nhe presented himself, always to the bravest Indians he \nwas the object of trembling reverence and awe. Nor can \nit be questioned from what stands on legendary record \nof this noble horse, that it was his spiritual whiteness \nchiefly, which so clothed him with divineness ; and that \nthis divineness had that in it which, though commanding \nworship, at the same time enforced a certain nameless \nterror. \n\nBut there are other instances where this whiteness loses \nall that accessory and strange glory which invests it in \nthe White Steed and Albatross. \n\nWhat is it that in the Albino man so peculiarly repels \nand often shocks the eye, as that sometimes he is loathed \nby his own kith and kin ! It is that whiteness which \ninvests him, a thing expressed by the name he bears. \nThe Albino is as well made as other men has no sub- \nstantive deformity and yet this mere aspect of all- \npervading whiteness makes him more strangely hideous \nthan the ugliest abortion. Why should this be so ? \n\nNor, in quite other aspects, does Nature in her least \npalpable but not the less malicious agencies, fail to enlist \namong her forces this crowning attribute of the terrible. \nFrom its snowy aspect, the gauntleted ghost of the \nSouthern seas has been denominated the White Squall. \nNor, in some historic instances, has the art of human \nmalice omitted so potent an auxiliary. How wildly it \n\n\n\nTHE WHITENESS OF THE WHALE 239 \n\nheightens the effect of that passage in Froissart, when, \nmasked in the snowy symbol of their faction, the desper- \nate White Hoods of Ghent murder their bailiff in the \nmarket-place ! \n\nNor, in some things, does the common, hereditary \nexperience of all mankind fail to bear witness to the \nsupernaturalism of this hue. It cannot well be doubted, \nthat the one visible quality in the aspect of the dead which \nmost appals the gazer, is the marble pallor lingering there ; \nas if indeed that pallor were as much like the badge of \nconsternation in the other world, as of mortal trepidation \nhere. And from that pallor of the dead, we borrow the \nexpressive hue of the shroud in which we wrap them. \nNor even in our superstitions do we fail to throw the same \nsnowy mantle round our phantoms ; all ghosts rising in \na milk-white fog Yea, while these terrors seize us, let \nus add, that even the king of terrors, when personified by \nthe evangelist, rides on his pallid horse. \n\nTherefore, in his other moods, symbolise whatever \ngrand or gracious thing he will by whiteness, no man can \ndeny that in its profoundest idealised significance it calls \nup a peculiar apparition to the soul. \n\nBut though without dissent this point be fixed, how is \nmortal man to account for it ? To analyse it would \nseem impossible. Can we, then, by the citation of some \nof those instances wherein this thing of whiteness \nthough for the time either wholly or in great part stripped \nof all direct associations calculated to impart to it aught \nfearful, but, nevertheless, is found to exert over us the \nsame sorcery, however modified ; can we thus hope to \nlight upon some chance clue to conduct us to the hidden \ncause we seek ? \n\nLet us try. But in a matter like this, subtlety appeals \nto subtlety, and without imagination no man can follow \nanother into these halls. And though, doubtless, some at \n\n\n\n240 MOBY-DICK \n\nleast of the imaginative impressions about to be presented \nmay have been shared by most men, yet few perhaps were \nentirely conscious of them at the time, and therefore may \nnot be able to recall them now. \n\nWhy to the man of untutored ideality, who happens to \nbe but loosely acquainted with the peculiar character of \nthe day, does the bare mention of Whitsuntide marshal \nin the fancy such long, dreary, speechless processions of \nslow-pacing pilgrims downcast and hooded with new- \nfallen snow ? Or, to the unread, unsophisticated Protes- \ntant of the Middle American States, why does the passing \nmention of a White Friar or a White Nun, evoke such an \neyeless statue in the soul ? \n\nOr what is there apart from the traditions of dungeoned \nwarriors and kings (which will not wholly account for it) \nthat makes the White Tower of London tell so much more \nstrongly on the imagination of an untravelled American \nthan those other storied structures, its neighbours the \nByward Tower, or even the Bloody ? And those sub- \nlimer towers, the White Mountains of New Hampshire, \nwhence, in peculiar moods, comes that gigantic ghostli- \nness over the soul at the bare mention of that name, while \nthe thought of Virginia's Blue Ridge is full of a soft, dewy, \ndistant dreaminess ? Or *why, irrespective of all latitudes \nand longitudes, does thg name of the White Sea exert \nsuch a spectralness over the fancy, while that of the \nYellow Sea lulls us with mortal thoughts of long lacquered \nmild afternoons on the waves, followed by the gaudiest \nand yet sleepiest of sunsets ? Or, to choose a wholly un- \nsubstantial instance, purely addressed to the fancy, why, \nin reading the old fairy tales of Central Europe, does ' the \ntall pale man ' of the Hartz forests, whose changeless \npallor unrustlingly glides through the green of the groves \nwhy is this phantom more terrible than all the whooping \nimps of the Blocksburg ? \n\n\n\nTHE WHITENESS OF THE WHALE 241 \n\nNor is it, altogether, the remembrance of her cathedral- \ntoppling earthquakes ; nor the stampedoes of her frantic \nseas ; nor the tearlessness of arid skies that never rain ; \nnor the sight of her wide field of leaning spires, wrenched \ncope-stones, and crosses all adroop (like canted yards of \nanchored fleets) ; and her suburban avenues of house- \nwalls lying over upon each other, as a tossed pack of \ncards ; it is not these things alone which make tearless \nLima the strangest, saddest city thou canst see. For \nLima has taken the white veil ; and there is a higher \nhorror in this whiteness of her woe. Old as Pizarro, \nthis whiteness keeps her ruins forever new ; admits not \nthe cheerful greenness of complete decay ; spreads over \nher broken ramparts the rigid pallor of an apoplexy that \nfixes its own distortions. \n\nI know that, to the common apprehension, this phe- \nnomenon of whiteness is not confessed to be the prime \nagent in exaggerating the terror of objects otherwise \nterrible ; nor to the unimaginative mind is there aught \nof terror in those appearances whose awfulness to another \nmind almost solely consists in this one phenomenon, \nespecially when exhibited under any form at all approach- \ning to muteness or universality. What I mean by these \ntwo statements may perhaps be respectively elucidated \nby the following examples. \n\nFirst : The mariner, when drawing nigh the coasts of \nforeign lands, if by night he hear the roar of breakers, \nstarts to vigilance, and feels just enough of trepidation to \nsharpen all his faculties ; but under precisely similar \ncircumstances, let him be called from his hammock to \nview his ship sailing through a midnight sea of milky \nwhiteness as if from encircling headlands shoals of \ncombed white bears were swimming round him then he \nfeels a silent, superstitious dread ; the shrouded phantom \nof the whitened waters is horrible to him as a real ghost ; \n\nVOL. I. Q \n\n\n\n242 MOBY-DICK \n\nin vain the lead assures him he is still off soundings ; heart \nand helm they both go down ; he never rests till blue \nwater is under him again. Yet where is the mariner who \nwill tell thee, ' Sir, it was not so much the fear of striking \nhidden rocks, as the fear of that hideous whiteness that \nso stirred me ' ? \n\nSecond : To the native Indian of Peru, the continual \nsight of the snow-howdahed Andes conveys naught of \ndread, except, perhaps, in the mere fancying of the eternal \nfrosted desolateness reigning at such vast altitudes, and \nthe natural conceit of what a fearfulness it would be to \nlose oneself in such inhuman solitudes. Much the same \nis it with the backwoodsman of the West, who with com- \nparative indifference views an unbounded prairie sheeted \nwith driven snow, no shadow of tree or twig to break the \nfixed trance of whiteness. Not so the sailor, beholding \nthe scenery of the Antarctic seas ; where at times, by \nsome infernal trick of legerdemain in the powers of frost \nand air, he, shivering and half shipwrecked, instead of \nrainbows speaking hope and solace to his misery, views \nwhat seems a boundless churchyard grinning upon him \nwith its lean ice monuments and splintered crosses. \n\nBut thou sayest, methinks this white -lead chapter \nabout whiteness is but a white flag hung out from a craven \nsoul ; thou surrenderest to a hypo, Ishmael. \n\nTell me, why this strong young colt, foaled in some \npeaceful valley of Vermont, far removed from all beasts \nof prey why is it that upon the sunniest day, if you but \nshake a fresh buffalo robe behind him, so that he cannot \neven see it, but only smells its wild animal muskiness \nwhy will he start, snort, and with bursting eyes paw the \nground in frenzies of affright ? There is no remem- \nbrance in him of any gorings of wild creatures in his green \nnorthern home, so that the strange muskiness he smells \ncannot recall to him anything associated with the experi- \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE WHITENESS OP THE WHALE 243 \n\nence of former perils ; for what knows he, this New \nEngland colt, of the black bisons of distant Oregon ? \n\nNo : but here thou beholdest even in a dumb brute, I.J^A \nthe instinct of the knowledge of the demonismjin the /* / \nworld. Though thousands of miles from Oregon, still \nwhen he smells that savage musk, the rending, goring \nbison herds are as present as to the deserted wild foal of \nthe prairies, which this instant they may be trampling \ninto dust. \n\nThus, then, the muffled rollings of a milky sea ; the \nbleak rustlings of the festooned frosts of mountains ; the \ndesolate shiftings of the windrowed snows of prairies ; \nall these, to Ishmael, are as the shaking of that buffalo \nrobe to the frightened colt ! \n\nThough neither knows where lie the nameless things of \nwhich the mystic sign gives forth such hints ; yet with s \nme, as with the colt, somewhere those things must exist. \nThough in many of its aspects this visible world seems \nformed in love, the invisible spheres were formed in fright. \n\nBut not yet have we solved the incantation of this \nwhiteness, and learned why it appeals with such power to \nthe soul ; and more strange and far more portentous \nwhy, as we have seen, it is at once the most meaning \nsymbol of spiritual things, nay, the very veil of the \nChristian's Deity ; and yet should be as it is, the intensi- \nfying agent in things the most appalling to mankind. \n\nIs it that by its indefiniteness it shadows forth the \nheartless voids and immensities of the universe, and thus \nstabs us from behind with the thought of annihilation, \nwhen beholding the white depths of the Milky Way ? Or \nis it, that as in essence whiteness is not so much a colour \nas the visible ^ absence^J_c^laar^ and at the same time the \nconcrete of all colours ; is it for these reasons that there \nis such a dumb blankness, full of meaning, in a wide \nlandscape of snows a colourless, all-colour of atheism \n\n\n\n244 MOBY-DICK \n\nfrom which we shrink ? And when we consider that other \ntheory of the natural philosophers, that all other earthly \nhues every stately or lovely emblazoning the sweet \ntinges of sunset skies and woods ; yea, and the gilded \nvelvets of butterflies, and the butterfly cheeks of young \ngirls ; all these are but subtle deceits, not actually in- \nherent in substances, but only laid on from without ; so \nthat all deified Nature absolutely paints like the harlot, \nwhose allurements cover nothing but the charnel-house \nwithin ; and when we proceed further, and consider \nthat the mystical cosmetic which produces every one of \nher hues, the great principle of light, forever remains \nwhite or colourless in itself, and if operating without \nmedium upon matter, would touch all objects, even \ntulips and roses, with its own blank tinge pondering all \nthis, the palsied universe lies before us a leper ; and like \nwilful travellers in Lapland, who refuse to wear coloured \nand colouring glasses upon their eyes, so the wretched \ninfidel gazes himself blind at the monumental white \nshroud that wraps all the prospect around him. And of \nall these things the Albino whale was the symbol. Wonder \nye then at the fiery hunt ? \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLIII \n\nHARK ! \n\n' HIST ! Did you hear that noise, Cabaco ? ' \n\nIt was the middle -watch : a fair moonlight ; the \nseamen were standing in a cordon, extending from one \nof the fresh-water butts in the waist, to the scuttle-butt \nnear the taffrail. In this manner, they passed the \nbuckets to fill the scuttle-butt. Standing, for the most \npart, on the hallowed precincts of the quarter-deck, they \nwere careful not to speak or rustle their feet. From hand \nto hand, the buckets went in the deepest silence, only \nbroken by the occasional flap of a sail, and the steady hum \nof the unceasingly advancing keel. \n\nIt was in the midst of this repose, that Archy, one of \nthe cordon, whose post was near the after-hatches, \nwhispered to his neighbour, a Cholo, the words above. \n' Hist ! did you hear that noise, Cabaco ? ' \n' Take the bucket, will ye, Archy ? what noise d' ye \nmean ? ' \n\n' There it is again under the hatches don't you hear \nit ? a cough it sounded like a cough.' \n\n' Cough be damned ! Pass along that return bucket.' \n' There again there it is ! it sounds like two or three \nsleepers turning over, now ! ' \n\n' Caramba ! have done, shipmate, will ye ? It 's the \nthree soaked biscuits ye eat for supper turning over inside \nof ye -nothing else. Look to the bucket ! ' \n\n4 Say what ye will, shipmate ; I 've sharp ears.' \n\n' Ay, you are the chap, ain't ye, that heard the hum \n\n245 \n\n\n\n246 MOBY-DICK \n\nof the old Quakeress's knitting-needles fifty miles at sea \nfrom Nantucket ; you 're the chap.' \n\n' Grin away ; we '11 see what turns up. Hark ye, \nCabaco, there is somebody down in the after-hold that \nhas not yet been seen on deck ; and I suspect our old \nMogul knows something of it too. I heard Stubb tell \nFlask, one morning-watch, that there was something of \nthat sort in the wind.' \n\n' Tish ! the bucket ! ' \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLIV \n\nTHE CHART \n\nHAD you followed Captain Ahab down into his cabin \nafter the squall that took place on the night succeeding \nthat wild ratification of his purpose with his crew, you \nwould have seen him go to a locker in the transom, and \nbringing out a large wrinkled roll of yellowish sea-charts, \nspread them before him on his screwed-down table. Then \nseating himself before it, you would have seen him intently \nstudy the various lines and shadings which there met his \neye ; and with slow but steady pencil trace additional \ncourses over spaces that before were blank. At intervals, \nhe would refer to piles of old log-books beside him, wherein \nwere set down the seasons and places in which, on various \nformer voyages of various ships, sperm whales had been \ncaptured or seen. \n\nWhile thus employed, the heavy pewter lamp suspended \nfoi chains over his head, continually rocked with the motion \nof the ship, and forever threw shifting gleams and shadows \nof lines upon his wrinkled brow, till it almost seemed that \nwhile he himself was marking out lines and courses on the \nwrinkled charts, some invisible pencil was also tracing \nlines and courses upon the deeply marked chart of his \nforehead. \n\nBut it was not this night in particular that, in the \nsolitude of his cabin, Ahab thus pondered over his charts. \nAlmost every night they were brought out ; almost every \nnight some pencil marks were effaced, and others were \nsubstituted. For with the charts of all four oceans before \n\n247 \n\n\n\n248 \n\n\n\nMOBY-DICK \n\n\n\nhim, Ahab was threading a maze of currents and eddies, \nwith a view to the more certain accomplishment of that \nmonomaniac thought of his soul. \n\nNow, to anyone not fully acquainted with the ways of \nthe leviathans, it might seem an absurdly hopeless task \nthus to seek out one solitary creature in the unhooped \noceans of this planet. But not so did it seem to Ahab, \nwho knew the sets of all tides and currents ; and thereby \ncalculating the drif tings of the sperm whale's food ; and, \nalso, calling to mind the regular, ascertained seasons for \nhunting him in particular latitudes ; could arrive at \nreasonable surmises, almost approaching to certainties, \nconcerning the timeliest day to be upon this or that \nground in search of his prey. \n\nSo assured, indeed, is the fact concerning the periodical- \nness of the sperm whale's resorting to given waters, that \nmany hunters believe that, could he be closely observed \nand studied throughout the world ; were the logs for one \nvoyage of the entire whale -fleet carefully collated, then \nthe migrations of the sperm whale would be found to \ncorrespond in invariability to those of the herring -shoals \nor the flights of swallows. On this hint, attempts have \nbeen made to construct elaborate migratory charts of the \nsperm whale. 1 \n\nBesides, when making a passage from one feeding- \nground to another, the sperm whales, guided by some \ninfallible instinct say, rather, secret intelligence from \n\n1 Since the above was written, the statement is happily borne out by an \nofficial circular, issued by Lieutenant Maury, of the National Observatory, \nWashington, April 16th, 1851. By that circular, it appears that precisely \nsuch a chart is in course of completion ; and portions of it are presented \nin the circular. ' This chart divides the ocean into districts of five degrees \nof latitude by five degrees of longitude ; perpendicularly through each \nof which districts are twelve columns for the twelve months ; and hori- \nzontally through each of which districts are three lines ; one to show the \nnumber of days that have been spent in each month in every district, and \nthe two others to show the number of days in which whales, sperm or \nright, have been seen.' \n\n\n\nTHE CHART 249 \n\nthe Deity mostly swim in veins, as they are called ; con- \ntinuing their way along a given ocean-line with such \nundeviating exactitude, that no ship ever sailed her \ncourse, by any chart, with one tithe of such marvellous \nprecision. Though, in these cases, the direction taken \nby any one whale be straight as a surveyor's parallel, and \nthough the line of advance be strictly confined to its \nown unavoidable, straight wake, yet the arbitrary vein \nin which at these times he is said to swim, generally \nembraces some few miles in width (more or less, as the \nvein is presumed to expand or contract) ; but never \nexceeds the visual sweep from the whale-ship's mast- \nheads, when circumspectly gliding along this magic zone. \nThe sum is, that at particular seasons within that breadth \nand along that path, migrating whales may with great \nconfidence be looked for. \n\nAnd hence not only at substantiated times, upon well- \nknown separate feeding-grounds, could Ahab hope to \nencounter his prey ; but in crossing the widest expanses \nof water between those grounds he could, by his art, so \nplace and time himself on his way, as even then not to be \nwholly without prospect of a meeting. \n\nThere was a circumstance which at first sight seemed to \nentangle his delirious but still methodical scheme. But \nnot so in reality, perhaps. Though the gregarious sperm \nwhales have their regular seasons for particular grounds, \nyet in general you cannot conclude that the herds which \nhaunted such and such a latitude or longitude this year, \nsay, will turn out to be identically the same with those \nthat were found there the preceding season ; though \nthere are peculiar and unquestionable instances where \nthe contrary of this has proved true. In general, the same \nremark, only within a less wide limit, applies to the soli- \ntaries and hermits among the matured, aged sperm whales. \nSo that though Moby-Dick had in a former year been seen, \n\n\n\n250 MOBY-DICK \n\nfor example, on what is called the Seychelle ground in the \nIndian Ocean, or Volcano Bay on the Japanese coast ; \nyet it did not follow, that were the Pequod to visit either \nof those spots at any subsequent corresponding season, \nshe would infallibly encounter him there. So, too, with \nsome other feeding -grounds, where he had at times \nrevealed himself. But all these seemed only his casual \nstopping-places and ocean-inns, so to speak, not his places \nof prolonged abode. And where Ahab's chances of \naccomplishing his object have hitherto been spoken of, \nallusion has only been made to whatever wayside, ante- \ncedent, extra prospects were his, ere a particular set time \nor place were attained, when all possibilities would become \nprobabilities, and, as Ahab fondly thought, every possi- \nbility the next thing to a certainty. That particular set \ntime and place were conjoined in the one technical phrase \nthe Season-on-the-Line. For there and then, for \nseveral consecutive years, Moby-Dick had been periodic- \nally descried, lingering in those waters for a while, as the \nsun, in its annual round, loiters for a predicted interval \nin any one sign of the Zodiac. There it was, too, that \nmost of the deadly encounters with the White Whale had \ntaken place ; there the waves were storied with his deeds ; \nthere also was that tragic spot where the monomaniac old \nman had found the awful motive to his vengeance. But \nin the cautious comprehensiveness and unloitering vigi- \nlance with which Ahab threw his brooding soul into this \nunfaltering hunt, he would not permit himself to rest all \nhis hopes upon the one crowning fact above mentioned, \nhowever flattering it might be to those hopes ; nor in the \nsleeplessness of his vow could he so tranquillise his unquiet \nheart as to postpone all intervening quest. \n\nNow, the Pequod had sailed from Nantucket at the very \nbeginning of the Season-on-the-Line. No possible en- \ndeavour then could enable her commander to make the \n\n\n\nTHE CHART 251 \n\ngreat passage southward, double Cape Horn, and then \nrunning down sixty degrees of latitude arrive in the \nequatorial Pacific in time to cruise there. Therefore, he \nmust wait for the next ensuing season. Yet the prema- \nture hour of the Pequod's sailing had, perhaps, been \ncorrectly selected by Ahab, with a view to this very com- \nplexion of things. Because, an interval of three hundred \nand sixty-five days and nights was before him ; an inter- \nval which, instead of impatiently enduring ashore, he \nwould spend in a miscellaneous hunt ; if by chance the \nWhite Whale, spending his vacation in seas far remote \nfrom his periodical feeding-grounds, should turn up his \nwrinkled brow off the Persian Gulf, or in the Bengal Bay, \nor China Seas, or in any other waters haunted by his race. \nSo that Monsoons, Pampas, Nor'-Westers, Harmattans, \nTrades ; any wind but the Levanter and Simoom, might \nblow Moby-Dick into the devious zig-zag world-circle of \nthe Pequod's circumnavigating wake. \n\nBut granting all this ; yet, regarded discreetly and \ncoolly, seems it not but a mad idea, this ; that in the broad \nboundless ocean, one solitary whale, even if encountered, \nshould be thought capable of individual recognition from \nhis hunter, even as a white-bearded Mufti in the thronged \nthoroughfares of Constantinople ? Yes. For the peculiar \nsnow-white brow of Moby-Dick, and his snow-white hump, \ncould not but be unmistakable. And have I not tallied \nthe whale, Ahab would mutter to himself, as after poring \nover his charts till long after midnight he would throw \nhimself back in reveries tallied him, and shall he escape ? \nHis broad fins are bored, and scalloped out like a lost \nsheep's ear ! And here, his mad mind would run on in a \nbreathless race ; till a weariness and faintness of ponder- \ning came over him ; and in the open air of the deck he \nwould seek to recover his strength. Ah, God ! what \ntrances of torments does that man endure who is consumed \n\n\n\n252 MOBY-DICK \n\nwith one unachieved revengeful desire. He sleeps with \nclenched hands ; and wakes with his own bloody nails in \nhis palms. \n\nOften, when forced from his hammock by exhausting \nand intolerably vivid dreams of the night, which, resuming \nhis own intense thoughts through the day, carried them \non amid a clashing of frenzies, and whirled them round \nand round in his blazing brain, till the very throbbing \nof his life-spot became insufferable anguish ; and when, \n\nwas sometimes the case, these spiritual throes in him \nheaved his being up from its base, and a chasm seemed \nopening in him, from which forked flames and lightnings \nshot up, and accursed fiends beckoned him to leap down \namong them ; when this hell in himself yawned beneath \nhim, a wild cry would be heard through the ship ; and \nwith glaring eyes Ahab would burst from his state-room, \nas though escaping from a bed that was on fire. Yet \nthese, perhaps, instead of being the unsuppressible \nsymptoms of some latent weakness, or fright at his own \nresolve, were but the plainest tokens of its intensity. For, \nat such times, crazy Ahab, the scheming, unappeasedly \nsteadfast hunter of the White Whale ; this Ahab that had \ngone to his hammock, was not the agent that so caused \nhim to burst from it in horror again. The latter was the \neternal, living principle or soul in him ; and in sleep, being \nfor the time dissociated from the characterising mind, \nwhich at other times employed it for its outer vehicle or \nagent, it spontaneously sought escape from the scorching \ncontiguity of the frantic thing, of which, for the time, it \nwas no longer an integral. But as the mind does not \nexist unless leagued with the soul, therefore it must have \nbeen that, in Ahab's case, yielding up all his thoughts and \nfancies to his one supreme purpose ; that purpose, by its \nown sheer inveteracy of will, forced itself against gods \nand devils into a kind of self-assumed, independent being \n\n\n\nTHE CHART 253 \n\nof its own. Nay, could grimly live and burn, while the \ncommon vitality to which it was conjoined, fled horror- \nstricken from the unbidden and unfathered birth. There- \nfore, the tormented spirit that glared out of bodily eyes, \nwhen what seemed Ahab rushed from his room, was for \nthe time but a vacated thing, a formless somnambulistic \nbeing, a ray of living light, to be sure, but without an \nobject to colour, and therefore a blankness in itself. God \nhelp thee, old man, thy thoughts have created a creature \nin thee ; and he whose intense thinking thus makes him \na Prometheus ; a vulture feeds upon that heart forever ; \nthat vulture the very creature he creates. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLV \n\nTHE AFFIDAVIT \n\nSo far as what there may be of a narrative in this book ; \nand, indeed, as indirectly touching one or two very inter- \nesting and curious particulars in the habits of sperm \nwhales, the foregoing chapter, in its earlier part, is as \nimportant a one as will be found in this volume ; but \nthe leading matter of it requires to be still further and \nmore familiarly enlarged upon, in order to be adequately \nunderstood, and moreover to take away any incredulity \nwhich a profound ignorance of the entire subject may \ninduce in some minds, as to the natural verity of the main \npoints of this affair. \n\nI care not to perform this part of my task methodically ; \nbut shall be content to produce the desired impression by \nseparate citations of items, practically or reliably known \nto me as a whaleman ; and from these citations, I take \nit, the conclusion aimed at will naturally follow of itself. \n\nFirst : I have personally known three instances where \na whale, after receiving a harpoon, has effected a complete \nescape ; and, after an interval (in one instance of three \nyears), has been again struck by the same hand, and slain ; \nwhen the two irons, both marked by the same private \ncipher, have been taken from the body. In the instance \nwhere three years intervened between the flinging of the \ntwo harpoons ; and I think it may have been something \nmore than that ; the man who darted them happening, \nin the interval, to go in a trading-ship on a voyage to \nAfrica, went ashore there, joined a discovery party, and \n\n254 \n\n\n\nTHE AFFIDAVIT 255 \n\npenetrated far into the interior, where he travelled for a \nperiod of nearly two years, often endangered by serpents, \nsavages, tigers, poisonous miasmas, with all the other \ncommon perils incident to wandering in the heart of un- \nknown regions. Meanwhile, the whale he had struck \nmust also have been on its travels ; no doubt it had thrice \ncircumnavigated the globe, brushing with its flanks all \nthe coasts of Africa ; but to no purpose. This man and \nthis whale again came together, and the one vanquished \nthe other. I say I, myself, have known three instances \nsimilar to this ; that is in two of them I saw the whales \nstruck ; and, upon the second attack, saw the two irons \nwith the respective marks cut in them, afterward taken \nfrom the dead fish. In the three-year instance, it so fell \nout that I was in the boat both times, first and last, and \nthe last time distinctly recognised a peculiar sort of huge \nmole under the whale's eye, which I had observed there \nthree years previous. I say three years, but I am pretty \nsure it was more than that. Here are three instances, \nthen, which I personally know the truth of ; but I have \nheard of many other instances from persons whose veracity \nin the matter there is no good ground to impeach. \n\nSecondly : It is well known in the sperm whale fishery, \nhowever ignorant the world ashore maybe of it, that there \nhave been several memorable historical instances where a \nparticular whale in the ocean has been at distant times \nand places popularly cognisable. Why such a whale \nbecame thus marked was not altogether arid originally \nowing to his bodily peculiarities as distinguished from \nother whales ; for however peculiar in that respect any \nchance whale may be, they soon put an end to his peculi- \narities by killing him, and boiling him down into a peculi- \narly valuable oil. No : the reason was this : that from \nthe fatal experiences of the fishery there hung a terrible \nprestige of perilousness about such a whale as there did \n\n\n\n256 MOBY-DICK \n\nabout Rinaldo Rinaldini, insomuch that most fishermen \nwere content to recognise him by merely touching their \ntarpaulins when he would be discovered lounging by them \non the sea, without seeking to cultivate a more intimate \nacquaintance. Like some poor devils ashore that happen \nto know an irascible great man, they make distant unob- \ntrusive salutations to him in the street, lest if they pursued \nthe acquaintance further, they might receive a summary \nthump for their presumption. \n\nBut not only did each of these famous whales enjoy \ngreat individual celebrity nay, you may call it an ocean- \nwide renown ; not only was he famous in life and now is \nimmortal in forecastle stories after death, but he was \nadmitted into all the rights, privileges, and distinctions \nof a name ; had as much a name indeed as Cambyses or \nCaesar. Was it not so, O Timor Tom ! thou famed \nleviathan, scarred like an iceberg, who so long didst lurk \nin the oriental straits of that name, whose spout was oft \nseen from the palmy beach of Ombay ? Was it not so, \nNew Zealand Jack ! thou terror of all cruisers that \ncrossed their wakes in the vicinity of the Tattoo Land? \nWas it not so, Morquan ! King of Japan, whose lofty \njet they say at times assumed the semblance of a snow- \nwhite cross against the sky ? Was it not so, Don \nMiguel ! thou Chilian whale, marked like an old tortoise \nwith mystic hieroglyphics upon the back I In plain prose, \nhere are four whales as well known to the students of \nCetacean History as Marius or Sylla to the classic scholar. \n\nBut this is not all. New Zealand Tom and Don Miguel, \nafter at various times creating great havoc among the \nboats of different vessels, were finally gone in quest of, \nsystematically hunted out, chased and killed by valiant \nwhaling-captains, who heaved up their anchors with that \nexpress object as much in view, as in setting out through \nthe Narragansett Woods, Captain Butler of old had it \n\n\n\nTHE AFFIDAVIT 257 \n\nin his mind to capture that notorious murderous savage \nAnnawon, the headmost warrior of the Indian King \nPhilip. \n\nI do not know where I can find a better place than just \nhere, to make mention of one or two other things, which \nto me seem important, as in printed form establishing \nin all respects the reasonableness of the whole story of \nthe White Whale, more especially the catastrophe. For \nthis is one of those disheartening instances where truth \nrequires full as much bolstering as error. So ignorant \nare most landsmen of some of the plainest and most \npalpable wonders of the world, that without some hints \ntouching the plain facts, historical and otherwise, of the \nfishery, they might scout at Moby-Dick as a monstrous \nfable, or still worse and more detestable, a hideous and \nintolerable allegory. \n\nFirst : Though most men have some vague flitting ideas \nof the general perils of the grand fishery, yet they have \nnothing like a fixed, vivid conception of those perils, \nand the frequency with which they recur. One reason \nperhaps is, that not one in fifty of the actual disasters and \ndeaths by casualties in the fishery, ever finds a public \nrecord at home, however transient and immediately \nforgotten that record. Do you suppose that that poor \nfellow there, who this moment perhaps caught by the \nwhale-line off the coast of New Guinea, is being carried \ndown to the bottom of the sea by the sounding leviathan \ndo you suppose that that poor fellow's name will appear \nin the newspaper obituary you will read to-morrow at \nyour breakfast ? No : because the mails are very \nirregular between here and New Guinea. In fact, did \nyou ever hear what might be called regular news direct \nor indirect from New Guinea ? Yet I tell you that \nupon one particular voyage which I made to the Pacific, \namong many others we spoke thirty different ships, every \n\nVOL. j. B \n\n\n\n258 MOBY-DICK \n\none of which had had a death by a whale, some of them \nmore than one, and three that had each lost a boat's crew. \nFor God's sake, be economical with your lamps and \ncandles ! not a gallon you burn, but at least one drop of \nman's blood was spilled for it. \n\nSecondly : People ashore have indeed some indefinite \nidea that a whale is an enormous creature of enormous \npower ; but I have ever found that when narrating to \nthem some specific example of this twofold enormousness, \nthey have significantly complimented me upon my \nfacetiousness ; when, I declare upon my soul, I had no \nmore idea of being facetious than Moses, when he wrote \nthe history of the plagues of Egypt. \n\nBut fortunately the special point I here seek can be \nestablished upon testimony entirely independent of my \nown. That point is this : The sperm whale is in some \ncases sufficiently powerful, knowing, and judiciously \nmalicious, as with direct aforethought to stave in, utterly \ndestroy, and sink a large ship ; and what is more, the \nsperm whale has done it. \n\nFirst : In the year 1820 the ship Essex, Captain \nPollard, of Nantucket, was cruising in the Pacific Ocean. \nOne day she saw spouts, lowered her boats, and gave chase \nto a shoal of sperm whales. Ere long, several of the \nwhales were wounded ; when, suddenly, a very large \nwhale escaping from the boats, issued from the shoal, \nand bore directly down upon the ship. Dashing his \nforehead against her hull, he so stove her in, that in less \nthan ' ten minutes ' she settled down and fell over. Not \na surviving plank of her has been seen since. After the \nseverest exposure, part of the crew reached the land in \ntheir boats. Being returned home at last, Captain \nPollard once more sailed for the Pacific in command of \nanother ship, but the gods shipwrecked him again upon \nunknown rocks and breakers ; for the second time his \n\n\n\nTHE AFFIDAVIT 259 \n\nship was utterly lost, and forthwith forswearing the sea, \nhe has never tempted it since. At this day Captain Pollard \nis a resident of Nantucket. I have seen Owen Chace, \nwho was chief mate of the Essex at the time of the tragedy ; \nI have read his plain and faithful narrative ; I have \nconversed with his son ; and all this within a few miles \nof the scene of the catastrophe. 1 \n\nSecondly : The ship Union, also of Nantucket, was in \nthe year 1 807 totally lost off the Azores by a similar onset, \nbut the authentic particulars of this catastrophe I have \nnever chanced to encounter, though from the whale- \nhunters I have now and then heard casual allusions to it. \n\nThirdly : Some eighteen or twenty years ago Commo- \ndore J , then commanding an American sloop -of -war \n\nof the first class, happened to be dining with a party of \nwhaling-captains, on board a Nantucket ship in the \n\n1 The following are extracts from Chace's narrative : ' Every fact \nseemed to warrant me in concluding that it was anything but chance \nwhich directed his operations ; he made two several attacks upon the ship, \nat a short interval between them, both of which, according to their \ndirection, were calculated to do us the most injury, by being made ahead, \nand thereby combining the speed of the two objects for the shook ; to \neffect which, the exact manoeuvres which he made were necessary. His \naspect was most horrible, and such as indicated resentment and fury. He \ncame directly from the shoal which we had just before entered, and in \nwhich we had struck three of his companions, as if fired with revenge for \ntheir sufferings.' Again : ' At all events, the whole circumstances taken \ntogether, all happening before my own eyes, and producing, at the time, \nimpressions in my mind of decided, calculating mischief, on the part of \nthe whale (many of which impressions I cannot now recall), induce me to \nbe satisfied that I am correct in my opinion.' \n\nHere are his reflections some time after quitting the ship, during a \nblack night in an open boat, when almost despairing of reaching any \nhospitable shore. ' The dark ocean and swelling waters were nothing ; \nthe fears of being swallowed up by some dreadful tempest, or dashed \nupon hidden rocks, with all the other ordinary subjects of fearful con- \ntemplation, seemed scarcely entitled to a moment's thought ; the dismal- \nlooking wreck, and the horrid aspect and revenge of the whale, wholly \nengrossed my reflections until day again made its appearance.' \n\nIn another place p. 45, he speaks of ' the mysterious and mortal \nattack of the animal.' \n\n\n\n260 MOBY-DICK \n\nharbour of Oahu, Sandwich Islands. Conversation turn- \ning upon whales, the commodore was pleased to be scepti- \ncal touching the amazing strength ascribed to them by the \nprofessional gentlemen present. He peremptorily denied, \nfor example, that any whale could so smite his stout sloop- \nof-war as to cause her to leak so much as a thimbleful. \nVery good ; but there is more coming. Some weeks after, \nthe commodore set sail in this impregnable craft for \nValparaiso. But he was stopped on the way by a portly \nsperm whale, that begged a few moments' confidential \nbusiness with him. That business consisted in fetching \nthe commodore's craft such a thwack, that with all his \npumps going he made straight for the nearest port to \nheave down and repair. I am not superstitious, but I \nconsider the commodore's interview with that whale as \nprovidential. Was not Saul of Tarsus converted from \nunbelief by a similar fright ? I tell you, the sperm whale \nwill stand no nonsense. \n\nI will now refer you to Langsdorff 's Voyages for a little \ncircumstance in point, peculiarly interesting to the writer \nhereof. Langsdorff, you must know by the way, was \nattached to the Russian Admiral Krusenstern's famous Dis- \nco very Expedition in the beginning of the present century. \nCaptain Langsdorff thus begins his seventeenth chapter. \n\n4 By the thirteenth of May our ship was ready to sail, \nand the next day we were out in the open sea, on our way \nto Ochotsh. The weather was very clear and fine, but \nso intolerably cold that we were obliged to keep on our \nfur clothing. For some days we had very little wind ; \nit was not till the nineteenth that a brisk gale from the \nnorth-west sprang up. An uncommon large whale, the \nbody of which was larger than the ship itself, lay almost \nat the surface of the water, but was not perceived by any- \none on board till the moment when the ship, which was \nin full sail, was almost upon him, so that it was impossible \n\n\n\nTHE AFFIDAVIT 261 \n\nto prevent its striking against him. We were thus placed \nin the most imminent danger, as this gigantic creature, \nsetting up its back, raised the ship three feet at least out \nof the water. The masts reeled, and the sails fell alto- \ngether, while we who were below all sprang instantly \nupon the deck, concluding that we had struck upon some \nrock ; instead of this we saw the monster sailing off with \nthe utmost gravity and solemnity. Captain D'Wolf \napplied immediately to the pumps to examine whether \nor not the vessel had received any damage from the \nshock, but we found that very happily it had escaped \nentirely uninjured.' \n\nNow, the Captain D'Wolf here alluded to as command- \ning the ship in question, is a New Englander, who, after \na long life of unusual adventures as a sea-captain, this \nday resides in the village of Dorchester near Boston. I \nhave the honour of being a nephew of his. I have par- \nticularly questioned him concerning this passage in Langs- \ndorfL He substantiates every word. The ship, however, \nwas by no means a large one : a Russian craft built on \nthe Siberian coast, and purchased by my uncle after \nbartering away the vessel in which he sailed from home. \n\nIn that up and down manly book of old-fashioned \nadventure, so full, too, of honest wonders the voyage \nof Lionel Wafer, one of ancient Dampier's old chums \nI found a little matter set down so like that just quoted \nfrom Langsdorff, that I cannot forbear inserting it here \nfor a corroborative example, if such be needed. \n\nLionel, it seems, was on his way to ' John Ferdi- \nnando,' as he calls the modern Juan Fernandez. ' In \nour way thither,' he says, 'about four o'clock in the \nmorning, when we were about one hundred and fifty \nleagues from the Main of America, our ship felt a terrible \nshock, which put our men in such consternation that they \ncould hardly tell where they were or what to think ; but \n\n\n\n262 MOBY-DICK \n\neveryone began to prepare for death. And, indeed, the \nshock was so sudden and violent, that we took it for granted \nthe ship had struck against a rock ; but when the amaze- \nment was a little over, we cast the lead, and sounded, but \nfound no ground. * * * The suddenness of the \nshock made the guns leap in their carriages, and several of \nthe men were shaken out of their hammocks. Captain \nDavis, who lay with his head on a gun, was thrown out \nof his cabin ! ' Lionel then goes on to impute the shock \nto an earthquake, and seems to substantiate the imputa- \ntion by stating that a great earthquake, somewhere about \nthat time,, did actually do great mischief along the Spanish \nland. But I should not much wonder if, in the darkness \nof that early hour of the morning, the shock was after all \ncaused by an unseen whale vertically bumping the hull \nfrom beneath. \n\nI might proceed with several more examples, one way \nor another known to me, of the great power and malice \nat times of the sperm whale. In more than one instance, \nhe has been known, not only to chase the assailing boats \nback to their ships, but to pursue the ship itself, and long \nwithstand all the lances hurled at him from its decks. \nThe English ship Pusie Hall can tell a story on that head ; \nand, as for his strength, let me say, that there have been \nexamples where the lines attached to a running sperm \nwhale have, in a calm, been transferred to the ship, and \nsecured there ; the whale towing her great hull through \nthe water, as a horse walks off with a cart. Again, it is \nvery often observed that, if the sperm whale, once struck, \nis allowed time to rally, he then acts, not so often with \nblind rage, as with wilful, deliberate designs of destruction \nto his pursuers ; nor is it without conveying some elo- \nquent indication of his character, that upon being attacked \nhe will frequently open his mouth, and retain it in that \ndread expansion for several consecutive minutes. But I \n\n\n\nTHE AFFIDAVIT 263 \n\nmust be content with only one more and a concluding \nillustration ; a remarkable and most significant one, by \nwhich you will not fail to see, that not only is the most \nmarvellous event in this book corroborated by plain \nfacts of the present day, but that these marvels (like all \nmarvels) are mere repetitions of the ages ; so that for \nthe millionth time we say amen with Solomon Verily \nthere is nothing new under the sun. \n\nIn the sixth Christian century lived Procopius, a Chris- \ntian magistrate of Constantinople, in the days when \nJustinian was Emperor and Belisarius general. As many \nknow, he wrote the history of his own times, a work every \nway of uncommon value. By the best authorities, he \nhas always been considered a most trustworthy and un- \nexaggerating historian, except in some one or two par- \nticulars, not at all affecting the matter presently to be \nmentioned. \n\nNow, in this history of his, Procopius mentions that, \nduring the term of his prefecture at Constantinople, a \ngreat sea-monster was captured in the neighbouring \nPropontis, or Sea of Marmora, after having destroyed \nvessels at intervals in those waters for a period of more \nthan fifty years. A fact thus set down in substantial \nhistory cannot easily be gainsaid. Nor is there any \nreason it should be. Of what precise species this sea- \nmonster was, is not mentioned. But as he destroyed \nships, as well as for other reasons, he must have been a \nwhale ; and I am strongly inclined to think a sperm whale. \nAnd I will tell you why. For a long time I fancied that \nthe sperm whale had been always unknown in the Medi- \nterranean and the deep waters connecting with it. Even \nnow I am certain that those seas are not, and perhaps \nnever can be, in the present constitution of things, a place \nfor his habitual gregarious resort. But further investi- \ngations have recently proved to me, that in modern times \n\n\n\n264 MOBY-DICK \n\nthere have been isolated instances of the presence of the \nsperm whale in the Mediterranean. I am told, on good \nauthority, that on the Barbary coast, a Commodore \nDavis of the British navy found the skeleton of a sperm \nwhale. Now, as a vessel of war readily passes through \nthe Dardanelles, hence a sperm whale could, by the same \nroute, pass out of the Mediterranean into the Propontis. \nIn the Propontis, as far as I can learn, none of that \npeculiar substance called brit is to be found, the aliment \nof the right whale. But I have every reason to believe \nthat the food of the sperm whale squid or cuttle-fish \nlurks at the bottom of that sea, because large creatures, \nbut by no means the largest of that sort, have been found \nat its surface. If, then, you properly put these statements \ntogether, and reason upon them a bit, you will clearly \nperceive that, according to all human reasoning, Pro- \ncopius's sea-monster, that for half a century stove the \nships of a Roman Emperor, must in all probability have \nbeen a sperm whale. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLVI \n\nSURMISES \n\nTHOUGH, consumed with the hot fire of his purpose, \nAhab in all his thoughts and actions ever had in view the \nultimate capture of Moby-Dick ; though he seemed ready \nto sacrifice all mortal interests to that one passion ; never- \ntheless it may have been that he was by nature and long \nhabituation far too wedded to a fiery whaleman's ways, \naltogether to abandon the collateral prosecution of the \nvoyage. Or at least if this were otherwise, there were \nnot wanting other motives much more influential with \nhim. It would be refining too much, perhaps, even con- \nsidering his monomania, to hint that his vindictiveness \ntoward the White Whale might have possibly extended \nitself in some degree to all sperm whales, and that the \nmore monsters he slew, by so much the more he multiplied \nthe chances that each subsequently encountered whale \nwould prove to be the hated one he hunted. But if such \nan hypothesis be indeed exceptionable, there were still \nadditional considerations which, though not so strictly \naccording with the wildness of his ruling passion, yet were \nby no means incapable of swaying him. \n\nTo accomplish his object Ahab must use tools ; and \nof all tools used in the shadow of the moon, men are most \napt to get out of order. He knew, for example, that \nhowever magnetic his ascendency in some respects was \nover Starbuck, yet that ascendency did not cover the \ncomplete spiritual man any more than mere corporeal \nsuperiority involves intellectual mastership ; for to the \n\n265 \n\n\n\n266 MOBY-DICK \n\npurely spiritual, the intellectual but stand in a sort of \ncorporeal relation. Starbuck's body and Starbuck's \ncoerced will were Ahab's, so long as Ahab kept his magnet \nat Starbuck's brain ; still he knew that for all this the \nchief mate, in his soul, abhorred his captain's quest, and \ncould he, would joyfully disintegrate himself from it, \nor even frustrate it. It might be that a long interval \nwould elapse ere the White Whale was seen. During that \nlong interval Starbuck would ever be apt to fall into open \nrelapses of rebellion against his captain's leadership, \nunless some ordinary, prudential, circumstantial influ- \nences were brought to bear upon him. Not only that, \nbut the subtle insanity of Ahab respecting Moby-Dick \nwas no ways more significantly manifested than in his \nsuperlative sense and shrewdness in foreseeing that, for \nthe present, the hunt should in some way be stripped of \nthat strange imaginative impiousness which naturally \ninvested it ; that the full terror of the voyage must be \nkept withdrawn into the obscure background (for few \nmen's courage is proof against protracted meditation \nunrelieved by action) ; that when they stood their long \nnight-watches, his officers and men must have some nearer \nthings to think of than Moby-Dick. For however eagerly \nand impetuously the savage crew had hailed the announce- \nment of his quest ; yet all sailors of all sorts are more or \nless capricious and unreliable they live in the varying \nouter weather, and they inhale its fickleness and when \nretained for any object remote and blank in the pursuit, \nhowever promissory of life and passion in the end, it is \nabove all things requisite that temporary interests and \nemployments should intervene and hold them healthily \nsuspended for the final dash. \n\nNor was Ahab unmindful of another thing. In times of \nstrong emotion mankind disdain all base considerations ; \nbut such times are evanescent. The permanent con- \n\n\n\nSURMISES 267 \n\nstitutional condition of the manufactured man, thought \nAhab, is sordidness. Granting that the White Whale \nfully incites the hearts of this my savage crew, and playing \nround their savageness even breeds a certain generous \nknight -errant ism in them, still, while for the love of it \nthey give chase to Moby-Dick, they must also have food \nfor their more common, daily appetites. For even the \nhigh lifted and chivalric Crusaders of old times were not \ncontent to traverse two thousand miles of land to fight \nfor their holy sepulchre, without committing burglaries, \npicking pockets, and gaining other pious perquisites by \nthe way. Had they been strictly held to their one final \nand romantic object that final and romantic object, \ntoo many would have turned from in disgust. I will not \nstrip these men, thought Ahab, of all hopes of cash ay, \ncash. They may scorn cash now ; but let some months \ngo by, and no perspective promise of it to them, and then \\ \nthis same quiescent cash all at once mutinying in them, \nthis same cash would soon cashier Ahab. \n\nNor was there wanting still another precautionary \nmotive more related to Ahab personally. Having im- \npulsively, it is probable, and perhaps somewhat pre- \nmaturely revealed the prime but private purpose of the \nPequod's voyage, Ahab was now entirely conscious that, \nin so doing, he had indirectly laid himself open to the \nunanswerable charge of usurpation ; and with perfect \nimpunity, both moral and legal, his crew if so disposed, \nand to that end competent, could refuse all further \nobedience to him, and even violently wrest from him the \ncommand. From even the barely hinted imputation \nof usurpation, and the possible consequences of such \na suppressed impression gaining ground, Ahab must of \ncourse have been most anxious to protect himself. That \nprotection could only consist in his own predominating \nbrain and heart and hand, backed by a heedful, closely \n\n\n\n268 MOBY-DICK \n\ncalculating attention to every minute atmospheric influ- \nence which it was possible for his crew to be subjected to. \n\nFor all these reasons then, and others perhaps too \nanalytic to be verbally developed here, Ahab plainly saw \nthat he must still in a good degree continue true to the \nnatural, nominal purpose of the Pequod's voyage ; observe \nall customary usages ; and not only that, but force \nhimself to evince all his well-known passionate interest \nin the general pursuit of his profession. \n\nBe all this as it may, his voice was now often heard \nhailing the three mast-heads and admonishing them to \nkeep a bright look-out, and not omit reporting even a \nporpoise. This vigilance was not long without reward. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLVII \n\nTHE MAT-MAKER \n\nIT was a cloudy, sultry afternoon ; the seamen were \nlazily lounging about the decks, or vacantly gazing over \ninto the lead-coloured waters. Queequeg and I were \nmildly employed weaving what is called a sword-mat, \nfor an additional lashing to our boat. So still and \nsubdued and yet somehow preluding was all the scene, \nand such an incantation of revelry lurked in the air, \nthat each silent sailor seemed resolved into his own \ninvisible self. \n\nI was the attendant or page of Queequeg, while busy \nat the mat. As I kept passing and repassing the filling \nor woof of marline between the long yarns of the warp, \nusing my own hand for the shuttle, and as Queequeg, \nstanding sideways, ever and anon slid his heavy oaken \nsword between the threads, and idly looking off upon \nthe water, carelessly and unthinkingly drove home every \nyarn : I say so strange a dreaminess did there then reign \nall over the ship and all over the sea, only broken by the \nintermitting dull sound of the sword, that it seemed as \nif this were the Loom of Time, and I myself were a shuttle \nmechanically weaving and weaving away at the Fates. \nThere lay the fixed threads of the warp subject to but one \nsingle, ever returning, unchanging vibration, and that \nvibration merely enough to admit of the crosswise inter- \nblending of other threads with its own. This warp \nseemed necessity ; and here, thought I, with my own hand \nI ply my own shuttle and weave my own destiny into these \n\n269 \n\n\n\n270 MOBY-DICK \n\nunalterable threads. Meantime, Queequeg's impulsive, \nindifferent sword, sometimes hitting the woof slantingly, \nor crookedly, or strongly, or weakly, as the case might \nbe ; and by this difference in the concluding blow pro- \nducing a corresponding contrast in the final aspect of the \ncompleted fabric ; this savage's sword, thought I, which \nthus finally shapes and fashions both warp and woof ; this \neasy, indifferent sword must be chance ay, chance, free \nwill, and necessity no wise incompatible all inter- \nweavingly working together. The straight warp of neces- \nsity, not to be swerved from its ultimate course its every \n/ alternating vibration, indeed, only tending to that ; free \nwill still free to ply her shuttle between given threads ; \nand chance, though restrained in its play within the right \nlines of necessity, and sideways in its motions directed \nby free will, though thus prescribed to by both, chance \nby turns rules either, and has the last featuring blow at \n\nevents. \n\n******* \n\nThus we were weaving and weaving away when I \nI started at a soundjgq strange, long drawn, and musically \nI wild and unearthly, that the ball of free will dropped from \nmy hand, and I stood gazing up at the clouds whence that \nvoice dropped like a wing. High aloft in the cross-trees \nwas that mad Gay-Header, Tashtego. His body was \nreaching eagerly forward, his hand stretched out like a \nwand, and at brief sudden intervals he continued his cries. \nTo be sure, the same sound was that very moment perhaps \nbeing heard all over the seas, from hundreds of whale- \nmen's look-outs perched as high in the air ; but from \nfew of those lungs could that accustomed old cry have \nderived such a marvellous cadence as from Tashtego the \nIndian's. \n\nAs he stood hovering over you half suspended in air, \nso wildly and eagerly peering toward the horizon, you \n\n\n\nTHE MAT-MAKER 271 \n\nwould have thought him some prophet or seer beholding \nthe shadows of Fate, and by those wild cries announcing \ntheir coming. \n\n' There she blows ! there ! there ! there ! she blows ! \nshe blows ! ' \n\n4 Where away ? ' \n\n' On the lee-beam, about two miles off ! a school of \nthem ! ' \n\nInstantly all was commotion. \n\nThe sperm whale blows as a clock ticks, with the \nsame undeviating and reliable uniformity. And thereby \nwhalemen distinguish this fish from other tribes of \nhis genus. \n\n' There go flukes ! ' was now the cry from Tashtego ; \nand the whales disappeared. \n\n4 Quick, steward ! ' cried Ahab. ' Time ! time ! ' \n\nDough-Boy hurried below, glanced at the watch, and \nreported the exact minute to Ahab. \n\nThe ship was now kept away from the wind, and she \nwent gently rolling before it. Tashtego reporting that \nthe whales had gone down heading to leeward, we con- \nfidently looked to see them again directly in advance of \nour bows. For that singular craft at times evinced by \nthe sperm whale when, sounding with his head in one \ndirection, he nevertheless, while concealed beneath the \nsurface, mills round, and swiftly swims off in the opposite \nquarter this deceitfulness of his could not now be in \naction ; for there was no reason to suppose that the fish \nseen by Tashtego had been in any way alarmed, or indeed \nknew at all of our vicinity. One of the men selected for \nship-keepers that is, those not appointed to the boats \nby this time relieved the Indian at the mainmast-head. \nThe sailors at the fore and mizen had come down ; the \nline-tubs were fixed in their places ; the cranes were \nthrust out ; the main-yard was backed, and the three \n\n\n\n272 MOBY-DICK \n\nboats swung over the sea like three samphire baskets over \nhigh cliffs. Outside of the bulwarks their eager crews with \none hand clung to the rail, while one foot was expectantly \npoised on the gunwale. So look the long line of man-of- \nwar's men about to throw themselves on board an enemy's \nship. \n\nBut at this critical instant a sudden exclamation was \nheard that took every eye from the whale. With a start \nall glared at dark Ahab, who was surrounded by five dusky \nphantoms that seemed fresh formed out of air. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLVIII \n\nTHE FIRST LOWERING \n\nTHE phantoms, for so they then seemed, were flitting on \nthe other side of the deck, and, with a noiseless celerity, \nwere casting loose the tackles and bands of the boat which \nswung there. This boat had always been deemed one \nof the spare boats, though technically called the captain's, \non account of its hanging from the starboard quarter. \nThe figure that now stood by its bows was tall and swart, \nwith one white tooth evilly protruding from its steel-like \nlips. A rumpled Chinese jacket of black cotton funereally \ninvested him, with wide black trowsers of the same dark \nstuff. But strangely crowning this ebonness was a \nglistening white plaited turban, the living hair braided \nand coiled round and round upon his head. Less swart \nin aspect, the companions of this figure were of that vivid, \ntiger-yellow complexion peculiar to some of the aboriginal \nnatives of the Manillas ; a race notorious for a certain \ndiabolism of subtlety, and by some honest white mariners \nsupposed to be the paid spies and secret confidential \nagents on the water of the devil, their lord, whose counting- \nroom they suppose to be elsewhere. \n\nWhile yet the wondering ship's company were gazing \nupon these strangers, Ahab cried out to the white-turbaned \nold man at their head, ' All ready there, Fedallah ? ' \n\n' Ready,' was the half -hissed reply. \n\n4 Lower away then ; d' ye hear ? ' shouting across the \ndeck. ' Lower away there, I say.' \n\nSuch was the thunder of his voice, that spite of their \n\nVOL. i. s \n\n\n\n274 MOBY-DICK \n\namazement the men sprang over the rail ; the sheaves \nwhirled round in the blocks ; with a wallow, the three \nboats dropped into the sea ; while, with a dexterous, off- \nhanded daring, unknown in any other vocation, the sailors, \ngoat-like, leaped down the rolling ship's side into the \ntossed boats below. \n\nHardly had they pulled out from under the ship's lee, \nwhen a fourth keel, coming from the windward side, \npulled round under the stern, and showed the five strangers \nrowing Ahab, who, standing erect in the stern, loudly \nhailed Starbuck, Stubb, and Flask, to spread themselves \nwidely, so as to cover a large expanse of water. But with \nall their eyes again riveted upon the swart Fedallah and \nhis crew, the inmates of the other boats obeyed not the \ncommand. \n\n' Captain Ahab ? ' said Starbuck. \n\n' Spread yourselves,' cried Ahab ; ' give way, all four \nboats. Thou, Flask, pull out more to leeward ! ' \n\n' Ay, ay, sir,' cheerily cried little King-Post, sweeping \nround his great steering -oar. ' Lay back ! ' addressing \nhis crew. ' There ! there ! there again ! There she \nblows right ahead, boys ! lay back ! ' \n\n' Never heed yonder yellow boys, Archy.' \n\n' Oh, I don't mind 'em, sir,' said Archy ; ' I knew it all \nbefore now. Didn't I hear 'em in the hold ? And didn't \nI tell Cabaco here of it ? What say ye, Cabaco ? They \nare stowaways, Mr. Flask.' \n\n' Pull, pull, my fine hearts-alive ; pull, my children ; \npull, my little ones,' drawlingly and soothingly sighed \nStubb to his crew, some of whom still showed signs of \nuneasiness. ' Why don't you break your backbones, my \nboys ? What is it you stare at ? Those chaps in yonder \nboat ? Tut ! They are only five more hands come to \nhelp us never mind from where the more the merrier. \nPull, then, do pull ; never mind the brimstone devils \n\n\n\nTHE FIRST LOWERING 275 \n\nare good fellows enough. So, so ; there you are now ; \nthat 's the stroke for a thousand pounds ; that 's the \nstroke to sweep the stakes ! Hurrah for the gold cup \nof sperm oil, my heroes ! Three cheers, men all hearts- \nalive ! Easy, easy ; don't be in a hurry don't be in a \nhurry. Why don't you snap your oars, you rascals ? \nBite something, you dogs ! So, so, so, then ; softly, \nsoftly ! That 's it that 's it ! long and strong. Give \nway there, give way ! The devil fetch ye, ye ragamuffin \nrapscallions ; ye are all asleep. Stop snoring, ye sleepers, \nand pull. Pull, will ye ? pull, can't ye ? pull, won't ye ? \nWhy in the name of gudgeons and ginger-cakes don't ye \npull ? pull and break something ! pull, and start your \neyes out ! Here ! ' whipping out the sharp knife from his \ngirdle ; ' every mother's son of ye draw his knife, and pull \nwith the blade between his teeth. That J s it that 's it. \nNow ye do something ; that looks like it, my steel-bits. \nStart her start her, my silver-spoons ! Start her, \nmarling-spikes ! ' \n\nStubb's exordium to his crew is given here at large, \nbecause he had rather a peculiar way of talking to them \nin general, and especially in inculcating the religion of \nrowing. But you must not suppose from this specimen \nof his sermonisings that he ever flew into downright \npassions with his congregation. Not at all ; and therein \nconsisted his chief peculiarity. He would say the most \nterrific things to his crew, in a tone so strangely com- \npounded of fun and fury, and the fury seemed so calcu- \nlated merely as a spice to the fun, that no oarsman could \nhear such queer invocations without pulling for dear \nlife, and yet pulling for the mere joke of the thing. Be- \nsides he all the time looked so easy and indolent himself, \nso loungingly managed his steering-oar, and so broadly \ngaped open-mouthed at times that the mere sight of \nsuch a yawning commander, by sheer force of contrast, \n\n\n\n276 MOBY-DICK \n\nacted like a charm upon the crew. Then again, Stubb \nwas one of those odd sort of humorists, whose jollity \nis sometimes so curiously ambiguous, as to put all in- \nferiors on their guard in the matter of obeying them. \n\nIn obedience to a sign from Ahab, Starbuck was now \npulling obliquely across Stubb 's bow ; and when for a \nminute or so the two boats were pretty near to each other, \nStubb hailed the mate. \n\n4 Mr. Starbuck ! larboard boat there, ahoy ! a word \nwith ye, sir, if ye please ! ' \n\n' Halloa ! ' returned Starbuck, turning round not a \nsingle inch as he spoke ; still earnestly but whisperingly \nurging his crew ; his face set like a flint from Stubb 's. \n\n' What think ye of those yellow boys, sir ? ' \n\n' Smuggled on board, somehow, before the ship sailed. \n(Strong, strong, boys ! ') in a whisper to his crew, then \nspeaking out loud again : ' A sad business, Mr. Stubb ! \n(Seethe her, seethe her, my lads !) but never mind, Mr. \nStubb, all for the best. Let all your crew pull strong, \ncome what will. (Spring, my men, spring !) There 's \nhogsheads of sperm ahead, Mr. Stubb, and that 's what \nye came for. (Pull, my boys !) Sperm, sperm 's the \nplay ! This at least is duty ; duty and profit hand in \nhand ! ' \n\n' Ay, ay, I thought as much,' soliloquised Stubb, \nwhen the boats diverged, c as soon as I clapt eye on 'em, \nI thought so. Ay, and that 's what he went into the \nafter-hold for, so often, as Dough -Boy long suspected. \nThey were hidden down there. The White Whale 's at \nthe bottom of it. Well, well, so be it ! Can't be helped ! \nAll right ! Give way, men ! It ain't the White Whale \nto-day ! Give way ! ' \n\nNow the advent of these outlandish strangers at such \na critical instant as the lowering of the boats from the \ndeck, this had not unreasonably awakened a sort of \n\n\n\nTHE FIRST LOWERING 277 \n\nsuperstitious amazement in some of the ship's company ; \nbut Archy's fancied discovery having some time previous \ngot abroad among them, though indeed not credited then, \nthis had in some small measure prepared them for the \nevent. It took off the extreme edge of their wonder ; \nand so what with all this and Stubb's confident way of \naccounting for their appearance, they were for the time \nfreed from superstitious surmisings ; though the affair \nstill left abundant room for all manner of wild conjectures \nas to dark Ahab's precise agency in the matter from the \nbeginning. For me, I silently recalled the mysterious \nshadows I had seen creeping on board the Pequod during \nthe dim Nantucket dawn, as well as the enigmatical \nhintings of the unaccountable Elijah. \n\nMeantime, Ahab, out of hearing of his officers, having \nsided the furthest to windward, was still ranging ahead \nof the other boats ; a circumstance bespeaking how potent \na crew was pulling him. Those tiger-yellow creatures of \nhis seemed all steel and whalebone ; like five trip-hammers \nthey rose and fell with regular strokes of strength, which \nperiodically started the boat along the water like a hori- \nzontal burst boiler out of a Mississippi steamer. As for \nFedallah, who was seen pulling the harpooneer-oar, he \nhad thrown aside his black jacket, and displayed his \nnaked chest with the whole part of his body above the \ngunwale, clearly cut against the alternating depressions \nof the watery horizon ; while at the other end of the boat \nAhab, with one arm, like a fencer's, thrown half backward \ninto the air, as if to counterbalance any tendency to trip ; \nAhab was seen steadily managing his steering -oar as in a j \nthousand boat lowerings ere the White Whale had torn( \nhim. All at once the outstretched arm gave a peculiar \nmotion and then remained fixed, while the boat's five oars \nwere seen simultaneously peaked. Boat and crew sat \nmotionless on the sea. Instantly the three spread boats \n\n\n\n278 MOBY-DICK \n\nin the rear paused on their way. The whales had irregu- \nlarly settled bodily down into the blue, thus giving no \ndistantly discernible token of the movement, though \nfrom his closer vicinity Ahab had observed it. \n\n4 Every man look out along his oars ! ' cried Starbuck. \n' Thou, Queequeg, stand up ! ' \n\nNimbly springing up on the triangular raised box in \nthe bow, the savage stood erect there, and with intensely \neager eyes gazed off toward the spot where the chase \nhad last been descried. Likewise upon the extreme stern \nof the boat where it was also triangularly platformed level \nwith the gunwale, Starbuck himself was seen coolly and \nadroitly balancing himself to the jerking tossings of his \nchip of a craft, and silently eyeing the vast blue eye of \nthe sea. \n\nNot very far distant Flask's boat was also lying breath- \nlessly still ; its commander recklessly standing upon the \ntop of the logger-head, a stout sort of post rooted in the \nkeel, and rising some two feet above the level of the stern \nplatform. It is used for catching turns with the whale - \nline. Its top is not more spacious than the palm of a \nman's hand, and standing upon such a base as that, Flask \nseemed perched at the mast-head of some ship which had \nsunk to all but her trucks. But little King-Post was small \nand short, and at the same time little King-Post was full \nof a large and tall ambition, so that this logger-head stand- \npoint of his did by no means satisfy King-Post. \n\nc I can't see three seas off ; tip us up an oar there, and \nlet me on to that.' \n\nUpon this, Daggoo, with either hand upon the gunwale ' \nto steady his way, swiftly slid aft, and then erecting him- \nself volunteered his lofty shoulders for a pedestal. \n\n' Good a mast-head as any, sir. Will you mount ? ' \n\n' That I will, and thank ye very much, my fine fellow ; \nonly I wish you fifty feet taller.' \n\n\n\nTHE FIRST LOWERING 279 \n\nWhereupon planting his feet firmly against two opposite \nplanks of the boat, the gigantic negro, stooping a little, \npresented his flat palm to Flask's foot, and then \nputting Flask's hand on his hearse-plumed head and \nbidding him spring as he himself should toss, with one \ndexterous fling landed the little man high and dry on \nhis shoulders. And here was Flask now standing, \nDaggoo with one lifted arm furnishing him with a breast- \nband to lean against and steady himself by. \n\nAt any time it is a strange sight to the tyro to see with \nwhat wondrous habitude of unconscious skill the whale- \nman will maintain an erect posture in his boat, even when \npitched about by the most riotously perverse and cross- \nrunning seas. Still more strange to see him giddily \nperched upon the logger-head itself, under such circum- \nstances. But the sight of little Flask mounted upon \ngigantic Daggoo was yet more curious ; for sustaining \nhimself with a cool, indifferent, easy, unthought-of, \nbarbaric majesty, the noble negro to every roll of the sea \nharmoniously rolled his fine form. On his broad back, \nflaxen-haired Flask seemed a snow-flake. The bearer \nlooked nobler than the rider. Though truly vivacious, \ntumultuous, ostentatious little Flask would now and then \nstamp with impatience ; but not one added heave did he \nthereby give to the negro's lordly chest. So have I seen \nPassion and Vanity stamping the living magnanimous' \nearth, but the earth did not alter her tides and her seasons \nfor that. \n\nMeanwhile Stubb, the third mate, betrayed no such \nfar-gazing solicitudes. The whales might have made \none of their regular soundings, not a temporary dive from \nmere fright ; and if that were the case, Stubb, as his \nwont in such cases, it seems, was resolved to solace the \nlanguishing interval with his pipe. He withdrew it from \nhis hat-band, where he always wore it aslant like a feather. \n\n\n\n280 MOBY-DICK \n\nHe loaded it, and rammed home the loading with his \nthumb-end ; but hardly had he ignited his match across \nthe rough sandpaper of his hand, when Tashtego, his \nharpooneer, whose eyes had been setting to windward like \ntwo fixed stars, suddenly dropped like light from his erect \nattitude to his seat, crying out in a quick frenzy of \nhurry, ' Down, down all, and give way ! there they are ! ' \n\nTo a landsman, no whale, nor any sign of a herring, \nwould have been visible at that moment ; nothing but a \ntroubled bit of greenish-white water, and thin scattered \npuffs of vapour hovering over it, and suffusingly blowing \noff to leeward, like the confused scud from white rolling \nbillows. The air around suddenly vibrated and tingled, \nas it were, like the air over intensely heated plates of \niron. Beneath this atmospheric waving and curling, and \npartially beneath a thin layer of water, also, the whales \nwere swimming. Seen in advance of all the other indi- \ncations, the puffs of vapour they spouted, seemed their \nforerunning couriers and detached flying outriders. \n\nAll four bojits were now in keen pursuit of that one spot \nof troubled water and air. But it bade far to outstrip \nthem ; it flew on and on, as a mass of interblending \nbubbles borne down a rapid stream from the hills. \n\n' Pull, pull, my good boys,' said Starbuck, in the lowest \npossible but intensest concentrated whisper to his men ; \nwhile the sharp fixed glance from his eyes darted straight \nahead of the bow, almost seemed as two visible needles \nin two unerring binnacle compasses. He did not say much \nto his crew, though, nor did his crew say anything to him. \nOnly the silence of the boat was at intervals startlingly \npierced by one of his peculiar whispers, now harsh with \ncommand, now soft with entreaty. \n\nHow different the loud little King-Post. ' Sing out \nand say something, my hearties. Roar and pull, my \nthunderbolts ! Beach me, beach me on their black backs, \n\n\n\nTHE FIRST LOWERING 281 \n\nboys ; only do that for me, and 1 11 sign over to you my \nMartha's Vineyard plantation, boys ; including wife and \nchildren, boys. Lay me on lay me on ! Lord, Lord ! \nbut I shall go stark, staring mad ! See ! see that white \nwater ! ' And so shouting, he pulled his hat from his \nhead, and stamped up and down on it ; then picking it \nup, flirted it far off upon the sea ; and finally fell to \nrearing and plunging in the boat's stern like a crazed \ncolt from the prairie. \n\n' Look at that chap now,' philosophically drawled \nStubb, who, with his unlighted short pipe, mechanically \nretained between his teeth, at a short distance, followed \nafter ' He 's got fits, that Flask has. Fits ? yes, give \nhim fits that 's the very word pitch fits into 'em. \nMerrily, merrily, hearts -alive. Pudding for supper, you \nknow ; merry 's the word. Pull, babes pull, sucklings \npull, all. But what the devil are you hurrying about ? \nSoftly, softly, and steadily, my men. Only pull, and keep \npulling ; nothing more. Crack all your backbones, and \nbite your knives hi two that 's all. Take it easy why \ndon't ye take it easy, I say, and burst all your livers and \nlungs ! ' \n\nBut what it was that inscrutable Ahab said to that \ntiger-yellow crew of his these were words best omitted \nhere ; for you live under the blessed light of the evangelical \nland. Only the infidel sharks in the audacious seas may \ngive ear to such words, when, with tornado brow, and \neyes of red murder, and foam-glued lips, Ahab leaped \nafter his prey. \n\nMeanwhile, all the boats tore on. The repeated specific \nallusions of Flask to ' that whale,' as he called the fictitious \nmonster which he declared to be incessantly tantalising \nhis boat's bow with his tail these allusions of his were at \ntimes so vivid and lifelike, that they would cause some \none or two of his men to snatch a fearful look over the \n\n\n\n\n\n\n282 MOBY-DICK \n\nshoulder. But this was against all rule ; for the oarsmen \nmust put out their eyes, and ram a skewer through their \nnecks ; usage pronouncing that they must have no \norgans but ears, and no limbs but arms, in these critical \nmoments. \n\nIt was a sight full of quick wonder and awe ! The vast \nswells of the omnipotent sea ; the surging, hollow roar \nthey made, as they rolled along the eight gunwales, like \ngigantic bowls in a boundless bowling-green ; the brief \nsuspended agony of the boat, as it would tip for an \ninstant on the knife-like edge of the sharper waves, that \nalmost seemed threatening to cut it in two ; the sudden \nprofound dip into the watery glens and hollows ; the \nkeen spurrings and goadings to gain the top of the opposite \nhill ; the headlong, sled-like slide down its other side ; \nall these, with the cries of the headsmen and harpooneers, \nand the shuddering gasps of the oarsmen, with the won- \ndrous sight of the ivory Pequod bearing down upon her \nboats with outstretched sails, like a wild hen after her \nscreaming brood ; all this was thrilling. Not the raw \nrecruit, marching from the bosom of his wife into the fever- \nheat of his first battle ; not the dead man's ghost en- \ncountering the first unknown phantom in the other world ; \nneither of these can feel stranger and stronger emotions \nthan that man does, who for the first time finds himself \npulling into the charmed, churned circle of the hunted \nsperm whale. \n\nThe dancing white water made by the chase was now \nbecoming more and more visible, owing to the increasing \ndarkness of the dun cloud-shadows flung upon the sea. \nThe jets of vapour no longer blended, but tilted every- \nwhere to right and left ; the whales seemed separating \ntheir wakes. The boats were pulled more apart ; Star- \nbuck giving chase to three whales running dead to lee- \nward. Our sail was now set, and, with the still rising \n\n\n\nTHE FIRST LOWERING 283 \n\nwind, we rushed along ; the boat going with such madness \nthrough the water, that the lee -oars could scarcely be \nworked rapidly enough to escape being torn from the \nrowlocks. \n\nSoon we were running through a suffusing wide veil of \nmist ; neither ship nor boat to be seen. \n\n4 Give way, men,' whispered Starbuck, drawing still \nfurther aft the sheet of his sail ; ' there is time to kill a \nfish yet before the squall comes. There 's white water \nagain ! close to ! Spring ! * \n\nSoon after, two cries in quick succession on each side \nof us denoted that the other boats had got fast ; but \nhardly were they overheard, when with a lightning-like \nhurtling whisper Starbuck said : ' Stand up ! ' and Quee- \nqueg, harpoon in hand, sprang to his feet. \n\nThough not one of the oarsmen was then facing the \nlife and death peril so close to them ahead, yet with their \neyes on the intense countenance of the mate in the stern \nof the boat, they knew that the imminent instant had \ncome ; they heard, too, an enormous wallowing sound \nas of fifty elephants stirring in their litter. Meanwhile \nthe boat was still booming through the mist, the waves \ncurling and hissing around us like the erected crests of \nenraged serpents. \n\n' That 's his hump. There, there, give it to him ! ' \nwhispered Starbuck. \n\nA short rushing sound leaped out of the boat ; it was \nthe darted iron of Queequeg. Then all in one welded \ncommotion came an invisible push from astern, while \nforward the boat seemed striking on a ledge ; the sail \ncollapsed and exploded ; a gush of scalding vapour shot \nup near by ; something rolled and tumbled like an earth- \nquake beneath us. The whole crew were half suffocated \nas they were tossed helter-skelter into the white curdling \ncream of the squall. Squall, whale, and harpoon had all \n\n\n\n284 MOBY-DICK \n\nblended together ; and the whale, merely grazed by the \niron, escaped. \n\nThough completely swamped, the boat was nearly \nunharmed. Swimming round it we picked up the floating \noars, and lashing them across the gunwale, tumbled back \nto our places. There we sat up to our knees in the sea, \nthe water covering every rib and plank, so that to our \ndownward-gazing eyes the suspended craft seemed a coral \nboat grown up to us from the bottom of the ocean. \n\nThe wind increased to a howl ; the waves dashed their \nbucklers together ; the whole squall roared, forked, and \ncrackled around us like a white fire upon the prairie, in \nwhich, unconsumed, we were burning ; immortal in these \njaws of death ! In vain we hailed the other boats ; as \nwell roar to the live coals down the chimney of a flaming \nfurnace as hail those boats in that storm. Meanwhile \nthe driving scud, rack, and mist grew darker with the \nshadows of night ; no sign of the ship could be seen. \nThe rising sea forbade all attempts to bale out the boat. \nThe oars were useless as propellers, performing now the \noffice of life-preservers. So, cutting the lashing of the \nwaterproof match keg, after many failures Starbuck \ncontrived to ignite the lamp in the lantern ; then stretch- \ning it on a waif -pole, handed it to Queequeg as the standard- \nbearer of this forlorn hope. There, then, he sat, holding \nup that imbecile candle in the heart of that almighty \nforlornness. There, then, he sat, the sign and symbol \nof a man without faith, hopelessly holding up hope in \nthe midst of despair. \n\nWet, drenched through, and shivering cold, despairing \nof ship or boat, we lifted up our eyes as the dawn came on. \nThe mist still spread over the sea, the empty lantern lay \ncrushed in the bottom of the boat. Suddenly Queequeg \nstarted to his feet, hollowing his hand to his ear. We all \nheard a faint creaking, as of ropes and yards hitherto \n\n\n\nTHE FIRST LOWERING 285 \n\nmuffled by the storm. The sound came nearer and \nnearer ; the thick mists were dimly parted by a huge, \nvague form. Affrighted, we all sprang into the sea as \nthe ship at last loomed into view, bearing right down upon \nus within a distance of not much more than its length. \n\nFloating on the waves we saw the abandoned boat, as \nfor one instant it tossed and gaped beneath the ship's \nbows like a chip at the base of a cataract ! and then the \nvast hull rolled over it, and it was seen no more till it \ncame up weltering astern. Again we swam for it, were \ndashed against it by the seas, and were at last taken up \nand safely landed on board. Ere the squall came close \nto, the other boats had cut loose from their fish and \nreturned to the ship in good time. The ship had given us \nup, but was still cruising, if haply it might light upon some \ntoken of our perishing, an oar or a lance pole. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER XL1X \n\nTHE HYENA \n\nTHERE are certain queer times and occasions in this \nstrange mixed affair we call life when a man takes this \nwhole universe for a vast practical joke, though the wit \nthereof he but dimly discerns, and more than suspects \nthat the joke is at nobody's expense but his own. How- \never, nothing dispirits, and nothing seems worth while \ndisputing. He bolts down all events, all creeds, and \nbeliefs, and persuasions, all hard things visible and in- \nvisible, never mind how knobby ; as an ostrich of potent \ndigestion gobbles down bullets and gun flints. And as \nfor small difficulties and worryings, prospects of sudden \ndisaster, peril of life and limb ; all these, and death itself, \nseem to him only sly, good-natured hits, and jolly punches \nin the side bestowed by the unseen and unaccountable \nold joker. That odd sort of wayward mood I am speaking \nof, comes over a man only in some time of extreme tribu- \nlation ; it comes in the very midst of his earnestness, so \nthat what just before might have seemed to him a thing \nmost momentous, now seems but a part of the general \njoke. There is nothing like the perils of whaling to breed \nthis free-and-easy sort of genial, desperado philosophy ; \nand with it I now regarded this whole voyage of the \nPequod, and the great White Whale its object. \n\n' Queequeg/ said I, when they had dragged me, the \n}ast man, to the deck, and I was still shaking myself in \nmy jacket to fling off the water ; ' Queequeg, my fine \nfriend, does this sort of thing often happen ? ' Without \n\n286 \n\n\n\nTHE HYENA 287 \n\nmuch emotion, though soaked through just like me, he \ngave me to understand that such things did often happen. \n\n4 Mr. Stubb,' said I, turning to that worthy, who, \nbuttoned up in his oil-jacket, was now calmly smoking \nhis pipe in the rain ; ' Mr. Stubb, I think I have heard you \nsay that of all whalemen you ever met, our chief mate, \nMr. Starbuck, is by far the most careful and prudent. I \nsuppose then, that going plump on a flying whale with your \nsail set in a foggy squall is the height of a whaleman's \ndiscretion ? ' \n\n1 Certain. I 've lowered for whales from a leaking \nship in a gale off Cape Horn.' \n\n4 Mr. Flask,' said I, turning to little King-Post, who was \nstanding close by ; ' you are experienced in these things, \nand I am not. Will you tell me whether it is an unalter- \nable law in this fishery, Mr. Flask, for an oarsman to break \nhis own back pulling himself back-foremost into death's \njaws ? ' \n\n' Can't you twist that smaller ? ' said Flask. ' Yes, \nthat 's the law. I should like to see a boat's crew backing \nwater up to a whale face foremost. Ha, ha ! the whale \nwould give them squint for squint, mind that ! J \n\nHere then, from three impartial witnesses, I had a \ndeliberate statement of the entire case. Considering, \ntherefore, that squalls and capsizings in the water and \nconsequent bivouacks on the deep, were matters of \ncommon -occurrence in this kind of life ; considering that \nat the superlatively critical instant of going on to the \nwhale I must resign my life into the hands of him who \nsteered the boat oftentimes a fellow who at that very \nmoment is in his impetuousness upon the point of scuttling \nthe craft with his own frantic stampings ; considering \nthat the particular disaster to our own particular boat was \nchiefly to be imputed to Starbuck's driving on to his whale \nalmost in the teeth of a squall, and considering that \n\n\n\n288 MOBY-DICK \n\nStarbuck, notwithstanding, was famous for his great \nheedfulness in the fishery ; considering that I belonged to \nthis uncommonly prudent Starbuck 's boat ; and finally \nconsidering in what a devil's chase I was implicated, \ntouching the White Whale : taking all things together, I \nsay, I thought I might as well go below and make a rough \ndraft of my will. ' Queequeg,' said I, ' come along, you \nshall be my lawyer, executor, and legatee/ \n\nIt may seem strange that of all men sailors should be \ntinkering at their last wills and testaments, but there are \nno people in the world more fond of that diversion. This \nwas the fourth time in my nautical life that I had done \nthe same thing. After the ceremony was concluded upon \nthe present occasion, I felt all the easier ; a stone was \nrolled away from my heart. Besides, all the days I should \nnow live would be as good as the days that Lazarus lived \nafter his resurrection ; a supplementary clean gain of so \nmany months or weeks as the case might be. I survived \nmyself ; my death and burial were locked up in my chest. \nI looked round me tranquilly and contentedly, like a quiet \nghost with a clean conscience sitting inside the bars of a \nsnug family vault. \n\nNow then, thought I, unconsciously rolling up the \nsleeves of my frock, here goes for a cool, collected dive \nat death and destruction, and the devil fetch the hindmost. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER L \nARAB'S BOAT AND CREW. FEDALLAH \n\n* WHO would have thought it, Flask ! ' cried Stubb. ' If \nI had but one leg you would not catch me in a boat, unless \nmaybe to stop the plug-hole with my timber toe. Oh ! \nhe 's a wonderful old man ! ' \n\n' I don't think it so strange, after all, on that account,' \nsaid Flask. ' If his leg were off at the hip, now, it would \nbe a different thing. That would disable him ; but he \nhas one knee, and good part of the other left, you know.' \n\n' I don't know that, my little man ; I never yet saw \n\nhim kneel.' \n\n******* \n\nAmong whale -wise people it has often been argued \nwhether, considering the paramount importance of his \nlife to the success of the voyage, it is right for a whaling- \ncaptain to jeopardise that life in the active perils of the \nchase. So Tamerlane's soldiers often argued with tears \nin their eyes, whether that invaluable life of his ought to \nbe carried into the thickest of the fight. \n\nBut with Ahab the question assumed a modified aspect. \nConsidering that with two legs man is but a hobbling \nwight in all times of danger ; considering that the pursuit \nof whales is always under great and extraordinary diffi- \nculties ; that every individual moment, indeed, then \ncomprises a peril ; under these circumstances is it wise \nfor any maimed man to enter a whale-boat in the hunt ? \nAs a general thing, the joint-owners of the Pequod must \nhave plainly thought not. \n\nVOL. I. T \n\n\n\n290 MOBY-DICK \n\nAhab well knew that although his friends at home \nwould think little of his entering a boat in certain com- \nparatively harmless vicissitudes of the chase, for the sake \nof being near the scene of action and giving his orders in \nperson, yet for Captain Ahab to have a boat actually \napportioned to him as a regular headsman in the hunt \nabove all, for Captain Ahab to be supplied with five extra \nmen, as that same boat's crew, he well knew that such \ngenerous conceits never entered the heads of the owners \nof the Pequod. Therefore he had not solicited a boat's \ncrew from them, nor had he in any way hinted his desires \non that head. Nevertheless he had taken private measure \nof his own touching all that matter. Until Cabaco's \npublished discovery, the sailors had little foreseen it, \nthough to be sure when, after being a little while out of \nport, all hands had concluded the customary business of \nfitting the whale-boats for service ; when some time after \nthis Ahab was now and then found bestirring himself in \nthe matter of making thole-pins with his own hands for \nwhat was thought to be one of the spare boats, and even \nsolicitously cutting the small wooden skewers, which \nwhen the line is running out are pinned over the groove \nin the bow ; when all this was observed in him, and par- \nticularly his solicitude hi having an extra coat of sheath- \ning in the bottom of the boat, as if to make it better \nwithstand the pointed pressure of his ivory limb ; and \nalso the anxiety he evinced in exactly shaping the thigh - \nboard, or clumsy cleat, as it is sometimes called, the hori- \nzontal piece in the boat's bow for bracing the knee against \nin darting or stabbing at the whale ; when it was observed \nhow often he stood up in that boat with his solitary knee \nfixed in the semicircular depression in the cleat, and \nwith the carpenter's chisel gouged out a little here and \nstraightened it a little there ; all these things, I say, had \nawakened much interest and curiosity at the time. But \n\n\n\nFEDALLAH 291 \n\nalmost everybody supposed that this particular prepara- \ntive heedfulness in Ahab must only be with a view to the \nultimate chase of Moby-Dick ; for he had already revealed \nhis intention to hunt that mortal monster in person. But \nsuch a supposition did by no means involve the remotest \nsuspicion as to any boat's crew being assigned to that \nboat. \n\nNow, with the subordinate phantoms, what wonder \nremained soon waned away ; for in a whaler wonders soon \nwane. Besides, now and then such unaccountable odds \nand ends of strange nations come up from the unknown \nnooks and ash-holes of the earth to man these floating \noutlaws of whalers ; and the ships themselves often pick \nup such queer castaway creatures found tossing about \nthe open sea on planks, bits of wreck, oars, whale-boats, \ncanoes, blown-off Japanese junks, and what not ; that \nBeelzebub himself might climb up the side and step down \ninto the cabin to chat with the captain, and it would not \ncreate any unsubduable excitement in the forecastle. \n\nBut be all this as it may, certain it is that while the \nsubordinate phantoms soon found their place among the \ncrew, though still as it were somehow distinct from them, \nyet that hair-turbaned Fedallah remained a muffled \nmystery to the last. Whence he came in a mannerly \nworld like this, by what sort of unaccountable tie he soon \nevinced himself to be linked with Ahab's peculiar fortunes; \nnay, so far as to have some sort of a half -hinted influence ; \nHeaven knows, but it might have been even authority \nover him ; all this none knew. But one cannot sustain an \nindifferent air concerning Fedallah. He was such a \ncreature as civilised, domestic people in the temperate \nzone only see in their dreams, and that but dimly ; but \nthe like of whom now and then glide among the unchang- \ning Asiatic communities, especially the oriental isles to \nthe east of the continent those insulated, immemorial, \n\n\n\n292 MOBY-DICK \n\nunalterable countries, which even in these modern days \nstill preserve much of the ghostly aboriginalness of earth's \nprimal generations, when the memory of the first man was \na distinct recollection, and all men his descendants, un- \nknowing whence he came, eyed each other as real phan- \ntoms, and asked of the sun and the moon why they were \ncreated and to what end ; when though, according to \nGenesis, the angels indeed consorted with the daughters \nof men, the devils also, add the uncanonical Rabbins, \nindulged in mundane amours. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER LI \n\nTHE SPIRIT- SPOUT \n\nDAYS, weeks passed, and under easy sail, the ivory Pequod \nhad slowly swept across four several cruising-grounds ; \nthat off the Azores ; off the Cape de Verdes ; on the \nPlate (so called), being off the mouth of the Bio de la \nPlata ; and the Carrol ground, an unstaked, watery \nlocality, southerly from St. Helena. \n\nIt was while gliding through these latter waters that \none serene and moonlight night, when all the waves rolled \nby like scrolls of silver ; and, by their soft, suffusing \nseethings, made what seemed a silvery silence, not a \nsolitude : on such a silent night a silvery jet was seen far ,; \nin advance of the white bubbles at the bow. Lit up by I \nthe moon, it looked celestial ; seemed some plumed and \nglittering god uprising from the sea. Fedallah first \ndescried this jet. For of these moonlight nights, it was \nhis wont to mount to the mainmast-head, and stand a \nlook-out there, with the same precision as if it had been \nday. And yet, though herds of whales were seen by \nnight, not one whalemen in a hundred would venture a \nlowering for them. You may think with what emotions, \nthen, the seamen beheld this old Oriental perched aloft \nat such unusual hours ; his turban and the moon, com- \npanions in one sky. But when, after spending his uniform \ninterval there for several successive nights without utter- \ning a single sound ; when, after all this silence, his un- \nearthly voice was heard announcing that silvery, moon-lit \njet, every reclining mariner started to his feet as if some \n\n293 \n\n\n\n294 MOBY-DICK \n\nwinged spirit had lighted in the rigging, and hailed the \nmortal crew. ' There she blows ! ' Had the trump of \njudgment blown, they could not have quivered more ; yet \nstill they felt no terror ; rather pleasure. For though it \nwas a most unwonted hour, yet so impressive was the cry, \nand so deliriously exciting, that almost every soul on \nboard instinctively desired a lowering. \n\nWalking the deck with quick, side -lunging strides, \nAhab commanded the t '-gallant-sails and royals to be set, \nand every stun' -sail spread. The best man in the ship \nmust take the helm. Then, with every mast-head manned, \nthe piled-up craft rolled down before the wind. The \nstrange, upheaving, lifting tendency of the taffrail breeze \nfilling the hollows of so many sails, made the buoyant, \nhovering deck to feel like air beneath the feet ; while \nstill she rushed along, as if two antagonistic influences \nwere struggling in her one to mount direct to heaven, 1 \nthe other to drive yawingly to some horizontal goal. H \nAnd had you watched Ahab's face that night, you would \nhave thought that in him also two different things were \nwarring. While his one live leg made lively echoes along \nthe deck, every stroke of his dead limb sounded like a \ncoffin-tap. On life and death this old man walked. But \nthough the ship so swiftly sped, and though from every \neye, like arrows, the eager glances shot, yet the silvery \njet was no more seen that night. Every sailor swore \nhe saw it once, but not a second time. \n\nThis midnight-spout had almost grown a forgotten \nthing, when, some days after, lo ! at the same silent hour, \nit was again announced : again it was descried by all ; \nbut upon making sail to overtake it, once more it dis- \nappeared as if it had never been. And so it served us \nnight after night, till no one heeded it but to wonder at \nit. Mysteriously jetted into the clear moonlight, or \nstarlight, as the case might be ; disappearing again for \n\n\n\nTHE SPIRIT-SPOUT 295 \n\none whole day, or two days, or three ; and somehow \nseeming at every distinct repetition to be advancing still \nfurther and further in our van, this solitary jet seemed \nforever alluring us on. \n\nNor with the immemorial superstition of their race, \nand in accordance with the preternaturalness, as it seemed, \nwhich in many things invested the Pequod, were there \nwanting some of the seamen who swore that whenever \nand wherever descried ; at however remote times, or in \nhowever far apart latitudes and longitudes, that unnear- \nable spout was cast by one self-same whale ; and that \nwhale, Moby-Dick. For a time, there reigned, too, a \nsense of peculiar dread at this flitting apparition, as if it \nwere treacherously beckoning us on and on, in order that \nthe monster might turn round upon us, and rend us at \nlast in the remotest and most savage seas. \n\nThese temporary apprehensions, so vague but so awful, \nderived a wondrous potency from the contrasting serenity \nof the weather, in which, beneath all its blue blandness, \nsome thought there lurked a devilish charm, as for days \nand days we voyaged along, through seas so wearily, \nlonesomely mild, that all space, in repugnance to our \nvengeful errand, seemed vacating itself of life before our \nurn-like prow. \n\nBut, at last, when turning to the eastward, the Cape \nwinds began howling around us, and we rose and fell upon \nthe long, troubled seas that are there ; when the ivory- \ntusked Pequod sharply bowed to the blast, and gored the \ndark waves in her madness, till, like showers of silver \nchips, the foam-flakes flew over her bulwarks ; then all \nthis desolate vacuity of life went away, but gave place \nto sights more dismal than before. \n\nClose to our bows, strange forms in the water darted \nhither and thither before us ; while thick in our rear flew \nthe inscrutable sea-ravens. And every morning, perched \n\n\n\n296 MOBY-DICK \n\non our stays, rows of these birds were seen ; and spite \nof our hootings, for a long time obstinately clung to the \nhemp, as though they deemed our ship some drifting, \nuninhabited craft ; a thing appointed to desolation, and \ntherefore fit roosting-place for their homeless selves. And \nheaved and heaved, still unrestingly heaved the black \nsea, as if its vast tides were a conscience ; and the great \nmundane soul were in anguish and remorse for the long \nsin and suffering it had bred. \n\nCape of Good Hope, do they call ye ? Rather Cape \nTormentoto, as called of yore ; for long allured by the \nperfidious silences that before had attended us, we found \nourselves launched into this tormented sea, where guilty \nbeings transformed into those fowls and these fish, \nseemed condemned to swim on everlastingly without any \nhaven in store, or beat that black air without any horizon. \nBut calm, snow-white, and unvarying ; still directing \nits fountain of feathers to the sky ; still beckoning us on \nfrom before, the solitary jet would at times be descried. \n\nDuring all this blackness of the elements, Ahab, though \nassuming for the time the almost continual command \nof the drenched and dangerous deck, manifested the \ngloomiest reserve ; and more seldom than ever addressed \nhis mates. In tempestuous times like these, after every- \nthing above and aloft has been secured, nothing more \ncan be done but passively to await the issue of the gale. \nThen captain and crew become practical fatalists. So, \nwith his ivory leg inserted into its accustomed hole, and \nwith one hand firmly grasping a shroud, Ahab for hours \nand hours would stand gazing dead to windward, while an \noccasional squall of sleet or snow would all but congeal \nhis very eyelashes together. Meantime, the crew driven \nfrom the forward part of the ship by the perilous seas \nthat burstingly broke over its bows, stood in a line along \nthe bulwarks in the waist ; and the better to guard against \n\n\n\nTHE SPIRIT-SPOUT 297 \n\nthe leaping waves, each man had slipped himself into a \nsort of bow-line secured to the rail, in which he swung as \nin a loosened belt. Few or no words were spoken ; and \nthe silent ship, as if manned by painted sailors in wax, \nday after day tore on through all the swift madness and \ngladness of the demoniac waves. By night the same \nmuteness of humanity before the shrieks of the ocean \nprevailed ; still in silence the men swung in the bow-lines ; \nstill wordless Ahab stood up to the blast. Even when \nwearied nature seemed demanding repose, he would not \nseek that repose in his hammock. Never could Starbuck \nforget the old man's aspect, when one night going down \ninto the cabin to mark how the barometer stood, he saw \nhim with closed eyes sitting straight in his floor-screwed \nchair ; the rain and half-melted sleet of the storm from \nwhich he had some time before emerged, still slowly \ndripping from the unremoved hat and coat. On the table \nbeside him lay unrolled one of those charts of tides and \ncurrents which have previously been spoken of. His \nlantern swung from his tightly clenched hand. Though \nthe body was erect, the head was thrown back so that the \nclosed eyes were pointed toward the needle of the tell- \ntale that swung from a beam in the ceiling. 1 \n\nTerrible old man ! thought Starbuck with a shudder, \nsleeping in this gale, still thou steadfastly eyest thy \npurpose. \n\n1 The cabin-compass is called the tell-tale, because, without going to \nthe compass at the helm, the captain, while below, can inform himself of \nthe course of the ship. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER LII \n\nTHE ALBATROSS \n\nSOUTH-EASTWARD from the Cape, off the distant Crozetts, \na good cruising -ground for right whalemen, a sail loomed \nahead, the Goney (Albatross) by name. As she slowly \ndrew nigh, from my lofty perch at the foremast -head, I \nhad a good view of that sight so remarkable to a tyro in \nthe far ocean fisheries a whaler at sea, and long absent \nfrom home. \n\nAs if the waves had been fullers, this craft was bleached \nlike the skeleton of a stranded walrus. All down her \nsides, this spectral appearance was traced with long \nchannels of reddened rust, while all her spars and her \nrigging were like the thick branches of trees furred over \nwith hoar-frost. Only her lower sails were set. A wild \nsight it was to see her long-bearded look-outs at those \nthree mast-heads. They seemed clad in the skins of beasts, \nso torn and bepatched the raiment that had survived \nnearly four years of cruising. Standing in iron hoops \nnailed to the mast, they swayed and swung over a fathom- \nless sea ; and though, when the ship slowly glided close \nunder our stern, we six men in the air came so nigh to each \nother that we might almost have leaped from the mast- \nheads of one ship to those of the other ; yet, those for- \nlorn-looking fishermen, mildly eyeing us as they passed, \nsaid not one word to our own look-outs, while the quarter- \ndeck hail was being heard from below. \n\n' Ship ahoy ! Have ye seen the White Whale ? ' \nBut as the strange captain, leaning over the pallid \n\n\n\nTHE ALBATROSS 299 \n\nbulwarks, was in the act of putting his trumpet to his \nmouth, it somehow fell from his hand into the sea ; and \nthe wind now rising amain, he in vain strove to make \nhimself heard without it. Meantime, his ship was still \nincreasing the distance between. While in various silent \nways the seamen of the Pequod were evincing their observ- \nance of this ominous incident at the first mere mention \nof the White Whale's name to another ship, Ahab for a \nmoment paused ; it almost seemed as though he would \nhave lowered a boat to board the stranger, had not the \nthreatening wind forbade. But taking advantage of his \nwindward position, he again seized his trumpet, and \nknowing by her aspect that the stranger vessel was a \nNantucketer and shortly bound home, he loudly hailed \n' Ahoy there ! This is the Pequod, bound round the \nworld ! Tell them to address all future letters to the \nPacific Ocean ! and this time three years, if I am not at \nhome, tell them to address them to ' \n\nAt that moment the two wakes were fairly crossed, and \ninstantly, then, in accordance with their singular ways, \nshoals of small harmless fish, that for some days before \nhad been placidly swimming by our side, darted away \nwith what seemed shuddering fins, and ranged themselves \nfore and aft with the stranger's flanks. Though in the \ncourse of his continual voyagings Ahab must often before \nhave noticed a similar sight, yet, to any monomaniac \nman, the veriest trifles capriciously carry meanings. \n\n' Swim away from me, do ye ? ' murmured Ahab, \ngazing over into the water. There seemed but little in \nthe words, but the tone conveyed more of deep helpless \nsadness than the insane old man had ever before evinced. \nBut turning to the steersman, who thus far had been \nholding the ship in the wind to diminish her headway, \nhe cried out in his old lion voice, ' Up helm ! Keep her \noff round the world ! ' \n\n\n\n300 \n\n\n\nMOBY-DICK \n\n\n\nRound the world ! There is much in that sound to \ninspire proud feelings ; but whereto does all that circum- \nnavigation conduct ? Only through numberless perils \nto the very point whence we started, where those that we \nleft behind secure, were all the time before us. \n\nWere this world an endless plain, and by sailing east- \nward we could forever reach new distances, and discover \nsights more sweet and strange than any Cyclades or Islands \nof King Solomon, then there were promise in the voyage. \nBut in pursuit of those far mysteries we dream of, or in \ntormented chase of that demon phantom that, some time \nor other, swims before all human hearts ; while chasing \nsuch over this round globe, they either lead us on in \nbarren mazes or midway leave us whelmed. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER LIII \n\nTHE GAM \n\nTHE ostensible reason why Ahab did not go on board of the \nwhaler we had spoken was this : the wind and sea be- \ntokened storms. But even had this not been the case, \nhe would not after all, perhaps, have boarded her judging \nby his subsequent conduct on similar occasions if so it \nhad been that, by the process of hailing, he had obtained \na negative answer to the question he put. For, as it \neventually turned out, he cared not to consort, even for \nfive minutes, with any stranger captain, except he could \ncontribute some of that information he so absorbingly \nsought. But all this might remain inadequately esti- \nmated, were not something said here of the peculiar usages \nof whaling-vessels wlfen meeting each other in foreign \nseas, and especially on a common cruising-ground. \n\nIf two strangers crossing the Pine Barrens in New York \nState, or the equally desolate Salisbury Plain in England ; \nif casually encountering each other in such inhospitable \nwilds, these twain, for the life of them, cannot well avoid \na mutual salutation ; and stopping for a moment to \ninterchange the news ; and, perhaps, sitting down for a \nwhile and resting in concert : then, how much more natural \nthat upon the illimitable Pine Barrens and Salisbury Plains \nof the sea, two whaling-vessels descrying each other at the \nends of the earth off lone Fanning 's Island, or the far \naway King's Mills ; how much more natural, I say, \nthat under such circumstances these ships should not only \ninterchange hails, but come into still closer, more friendly \nand sociable contact. And especially would this seem to \n\n901 \n\n\n\n302 MOBY-DICK \n\nbe a matter of course, in the case of vessels owned in one \nseaport, and whose captains, officers, and not a few of the \nmen are personally known to each other ; and consequently, \nhave all sorts of dear domestic things to talk about. \n\nFor the long absent ship, the outward-bounder, per- \nhaps, has letters on board ; at any rate, she will be sure \nto let her have some papers of a date a year or two later \nthan the last one on her blurred and thumb-worn files. \nAnd in return for that courtesy, the outward-bound ship \nwould receive the latest whaling intelligence from the \ncruising-ground to which she may be destined, a thing of \nthe utmost importance to her. And in degree, all this \nwill hold true concerning whaling-vessels crossing each \nother's track on the cruising-ground itself, even though \nthey are equally long absent from home. For one of them \nmay have received a transfer of letters from some third, \nand now far remote vessel ; and some of those letters \nmay be for the people of the ship she now meets. Besides, \nthey would exchange the whaling news, and have an \nagreeable chat. For not only would they meet with all \nthe sympathies of sailors, but likewise with all the peculiar \ncongenialities arising from a common pursuit and mutually \nshared privations and perils. \n\nNor would difference of country make any very essential \ndifference ; that is, so long as both parties speak one lan- \nguage, as is the case with Americans and English. \nThough, to be sure, from the small number of English \nwhalers, such meetings do not very often occur, and when \nthey do occur there is too apt to be a sort of shyness \nbetween them ; for your Englishman is rather reserved, \nand your Yankee, he does not fancy that sort of thing \nin anybody but himself. Besides, the English whalers \nsometimes affect a kind of metropolitan superiority over \nthe American whalers ; regarding the long, lean Nan- \ntucketer, with his nondescript provincialisms, as a sort \nof sea-peasant. But where this superiority in the English \n\n\n\nTHE GAM 303 \n\nwhalemen does really consist, it would be hard to say, \nseeing that the Yankees in one day, collectively, kill more \nwhales than all the English, collectively, in ten years. \nBut this is a harmless little foible in the English whale- \nhunters, which the Nantucketer does not take much to \nheart ; probably, because he knows that he has a few \nfoibles himself. \n\nSo, then, we see that of all ships separately sailing the \nsea, the whalers have most reason to be sociable and \nthey are so. Whereas, some merchant ships crossing \neach other's wake in the mid- Atlantic, will oftentimes \npass on without so much as a single word of recognition, \nmutually cutting each other on the high seas, like a brace \nof dandies in Broadway ; and all the time indulging, \nperhaps, in finical criticism upon each other's rig. As \nfor men-of-war, when they chance to meet at sea, they \nfirst go through such a string of silly bowings and scrapings, \nsuch a ducking of ensigns, that there does not seem to be \nmuch right-down hearty goodwill and brotherly love \nabout it at all. As touching slave-ships meeting, why, they \nare in such a prodigious hurry, they run away from each \nother as soon as possible. And as for pirates, when they \nchance to cross each other's cross-bones, the first hail is, \n' How many skulls ? ' the same way that whalers hail \n' How many barrels ? ' And that question once answered, \npirates straightway steer apart, for they are infernal \nvillains on both sides, and don't like to see overmuch of \neach other's villainous likenesses. \n\nBut look at the godly, honest, unostentatious, hos- \npitable, sociable, free-and-easy whaler ! What does the \nwhaler do when she meets another whaler in any sort of \ndecent weather ? She has a ' Gam,' a thing so utterly \nunknown to all other ships that they never heard of the \nname even ; and if by chance they should hear of it, they \nonly grin at it, and repeat gamesome stuff about 'spouters' \nand c blubber-boilers,' and such like pretty exclamations. \n\n\n\n304 MOBY-DICK \n\nWhy it is that all merchant seamen, and also all pirates \nand man-of-war's men, and slave-ship sailors, cherish \nsuch a scornful feeling toward whale-ships ; this is a \nquestion it would be hard to answer. Because, in the \ncase of pirates, say, I should like to know whether that \nprofession of theirs has any peculiar glory about it. It \nsometimes ends in uncommon elevation, indeed ; but only \nat the gallows. And besides, when a man is elevated in \nthat odd fashion, he has no proper foundation for his \nsuperior altitude. Hence, I conclude, that in boasting \nhimself to be high lifted above a whaleman, in that \nassertion the pirate has no solid basis to stand on. \n\nBut what is a Gam ? You might wear out your index \nfinger running up and down the columns of dictionaries, \nand never find the word. Dr. Johnson never attained \nto that erudition ; Noah Webster's ark does not hold it. \nNevertheless, this same expressive word has now for \nmany years been in constant use among some fifteen \nthousand true-born Yankees. Certainly, it needs a \ndefinition, and should be incorporated into the Lexicon. \nWith that view, let me learnedly define it. \n\nGAM. NOUN A social meeting of two (or more) \nwhale-ships, generally on a cruising-ground ; when, after \nexchanging hails, they exchange visits by boats' crews : the \ntwo captains remaining, for the time, on board of one ship t \nand the two chief mates on the other. \n\nThere is another little item about Gamming which must \nnot be forgotten here. All professions have their own \nlittle peculiarities of detail ; so has the whale-fishery. In \na pirate, man-of-war, or slave-ship, when the captain \nis rowed anywhere hi his boat, he always sits in the stern- \nsheets on a comfortable, sometimes cushioned seat there, \nand often steers himself with a pretty little milliner's \ntiller decorated with gay cords and ribbons. But the \nwhale-boat has no seat astern, no sofa of that sort what- \n\n\n\nTHE GAM 305 \n\never, and no tiller at all. High times indeed, if whaling- \ncaptains were wheeled about the water on castors like \ngouty old aldermen in patent chairs. And as for a tiller, \nthe whale-boat never admits of any such effeminacy ; and \ntherefore as in gamming a complete boat's crew must \nleave the ship, and hence as the boat steerer or harpooneer \nis of the number, that subordinate is the steersman upon \nthe occasion, and the captain, having no place to sit in, \nis pulled off to his visit all standing like a pine-tree. And \noften you will notice that being conscious of the eyes of \nthe whole visible world resting on him from the sides of \nthe two ships, this standing captain is all alive to the \nimportance of sustaining his dignity by maintaining his \nlegs. Nor is this any very easy matter ; for in his rear \nis the immense projecting steering-oar hitting him now \nand then in the small of his back, the after-oar reciprocat- \ning by rapping his knees in front. He is thus completely \nwedged before and behind, and can only expand himself \nsideways by settling down on his stretched legs ; but a \nsudden, violent pitch of the boat will often go far to topple \nhim, because length of foundation is nothing without \ncorresponding breadth. Merely make a spread angle of \ntwo poles, and you cannot stand them up. Then, again, \nit would never do in plain sight of the world's riveted \neyes, it would never do, I say, for this straddling captain \nto be seen steadying himself the slightest particle by \ncatching hold of anything with his hands ; indeed, as \ntoken of his entire, buoyant self-command, he generally \ncarries his hands in his trowsers' pockets ; but perhaps \nbeing generally very large, heavy hands, he carries them \nthere for ballast. Nevertheless there have occurred \ninstances, well authenticated ones too, where the captain \nhas been known for an uncommonly critical moment or \ntwo, in a sudden squall, say to seize hold of the nearest \noarsman's hair, and hold on there like grim death. \nVOL. i. u \n\n\n\nCHAPTER L1V \n\nTHE TOWN-HO'S STORY \n\n(As told at the Golden Inn.) \n\nTHE Cape of Good Hope, and all the watery region round \nabout there, is much like some noted four corners of a \ngreat highway, where you meet more travellers than in \nany other part. \n\nIt was not very long after speaking the Goney that \nanother homeward-bound whaleman, the Town-Ho? was \nencountered. She was manned almost wholly by Poly- \nnesians. In the short gam that ensued she gave us strong \nnews of Moby-Dick. To some the general interest in the \nWhite Whale was now wildly heightened by a circumstance \nof the Town-Ho' s story, which seemed obscurely to in- \nvolve with the whale a certain wondrous, inverted visi- \ntation of one of those so-called judgments of God which \nat times are said to overtake some men. This latter \ncircumstance, with its own particular accompaniments, \nforming what may be called the secret part of the tragedy \nabout to be narrated, never reached the ears of Captain \nAhab or his mates. For that secret part of the story was \nunknown to the captain of the Town-Ho himself. It was \nthe private property of three confederate white seamen \nof that ship, one of whom, it seems, communicated it to \nTashtego with Romish injunctions of secrecy, but the \nfollowing night Tashtego rambled in his sleep, \n\n1 The ancient whale-cry upon first sighting a whale from the mast-1 \nstill used by \\vhalemen in hunting the famous Gallipagos terrapin. \n306 \n\n\n\nTHE TOWN-HO'S STORY 307 \n\nrevealed so much of it in that way, that when he was \nwakened he could not well withhold the rest. Neverthe- \nless, so potent an influence did this thing have on those \nseamen in the Pequod who came to the full knowledge of \nit, and by such a strange delicacy, to call it so, were they \ngoverned in this matter, that they kept the secret among \nthemselves so that it never transpired abaft the Peqiwd's \nmainmast. Interweaving in its proper place this darker \nthread with the story as publicly narrated on the ship, \nthe whole of this strange affair I now proceed to put on \nlasting record. \n\nFor my humour's sake, I shall preserve the style in \nwhich I once narrated it at Lima, to a lounging circle of \nmy Spanish friends, one saint's eve, smoking upon the \nthick-gilt tiled piazza of the Golden Inn. Of those fine \ncavaliers, the young Dons, Pedro and Sebastian, were on \nthe closer terms with me ; and hence the interluding \nquestions they occasionally put, and which are duly \nanswered at the time. \n\n4 Some two years prior to my first learning the events \nwhich I am about rehearsing to you, gentlemen, the Town- \nHo, sperm whaler of Nantucket, was cruising in your \nPacific here, not very many days' sail westward from the \neaves of this good Golden Inn. She was somewhere \nto the northward of the Line. One morning upon hand- \nling the pumps, according to daily usage, it was observed \nthat she made more water in her hold than common. \nThey supposed a sword-fish had stabbed her, gentlemen. \nBut the captain, having some unusual reason for believing \nthat rare good luck awaited him in those latitudes, and \ntherefore being very averse to quit them ; and the leak \nnot being then considered at all dangerous, though, \nindeed, they could not find it after searching the hold as \nlow down as was possible in rather heavy weather ; the \nship still continued her cruisings, the mariners working \n\n\n\n308 MOBY-DICK \n\nat the pumps at wide and easy intervals ; but no good luck \ncame ; more days went by, and not only was the leak yet \nundiscovered, but it sensibly increased. So much so, \nthat now taking some alarm, the captain, making all sail, \nstood away for the nearest harbour among the islands, \nthere to have his hull hove out and repaired. \n\n4 Though no small passage was before her, yet, if the \ncommonest chance favoured, he did not at all fear that \nhis ship would founder by the way, because his pumps \nwere of the best, and being periodically relieved at them, \nthose six-and-thirty men of his could easily keep the ship \nfree ; never mind if the leak should double on her. In \ntruth, well-nigh the whole of this passage being attended \nby very prosperous breezes, the Town-Ho had all but \ncertainly arrived in perfect safety at her port without \nthe occurrence of the least fatality, had it not been for the \nbrutal overbearing of Radney, the mate, a Vineyarder, and \nthe bitterly provoked vengeance of Steelkilt, a Lakeman \nand desperado from Buffalo. \n\n' \" Lakeman ! Buffalo ! Pray, what is a Lakeman, \nand where is Buffalo ? \" said Don Sebastian, rising in his \nswinging mat of grass. \n\n' On the eastern shore of our Lake Erie, Don ; but \nI crave your courtesy maybe, you shall soon hear \nfurther of all that. Now, gentlemen, in square-sail brigs \nand three-masted ships, well-nigh as large and stout as \nany that ever sailed out of your old Callao to far Manilla ; \nthis Lakeman, in the land-locked heart of our America, \nhad yet been nurtured by all those agrarian freebooting \nimpressions popularly connected with the open ocean. \nFor in their interflowing aggregate, those grand fresh- \nwater seas of ours, Erie, and Ontario, and Huron, and \nSuperior, and Michigan, possess an ocean -like expansive- \nness, with many of the ocean's noblest traits ; with many \nof its rimmed varieties of races and of climes. They \n\n\n\nTHE TOWN-HO'S STORY 309 \n\ncontain round archipelagoes of romantic isles, even as the \nPolynesian waters do ; in large part, are shored by two \ngreat contrasting nations, as the Atlantic is ; they furnish \nlong maritime approaches to our numerous territorial \ncolonies from the East, dotted all round their banks ; ; \nhere and there are frowned upon by batteries, and by \nthe goat-like craggy guns of lofty Mackinaw ; they have \nheard the fleet thunderings of naval victories ; at intervals \nthey yield their beaches to wild barbarians, whose red- \npainted faces flash from out their peltry wigwams ; for \nleagues and leagues are flanked by ancient and unentered \nforests, where the gaunt pines stand like serried lines of \nkings in Gothic genealogies ; those same woods harbour- \ning wild Afric beasts of prey, and silken creatures whose \nexported furs give robes to Tartar emperors ; they mirror \nthe paved capitals of Buffalo and Cleveland, as well as \nWinnebago villages ; they float alike the full-rigged \nmerchant ship, the armed cruiser of the State, the steamer, \nand the beech canoe ; they are swept by Borean and dis- \nmasting blasts as direful as any that lash the salted wave ; \nthey know what shipwrecks are, for out of sight of land, \nhowever inland, they have drowned full many a midnight \nship with all its shrieking crew. Thus, gentlemen, though \nan inlander, Steelkilt was wild-ocean born, and wild- \nocean nurtured ; as much of an audacious mariner as \nany. And for Radney, though in his infancy he may have \nlaid him down on the lone Nantucket beach, to nurse at \nhis maternal sea ; though in after life he had long followed \nour austere Atlantic and your contemplative Pacific ; yet \nwas he quite as vengeful and full of social quarrel as the \nbackwoods seaman, fresh from the latitudes of buck-horn \nhandled bowie-knives. Yet was this Nantucketer a man \nwith some good-hearted traits ; and this Lakeman, a \nmariner, who though a sort of devil indeed, might yet by \ninflexible firmness, only tempered by that common \n\n\n\n310 MOBY-DICK \n\ndecency of human recognition which is the meanest \nslave's right ; thus treated, this Steelkilt had long been \nretained harmless and docile. At all events, he had \nproved so thus far ; but Radney was doomed and made \nmad, and Steelkilt but, gentlemen, you shall hear. \n\n' It was not more than a day or two at the furthest \nafter pointing her prow for her island haven, that the \nTown-Ho's leak seemed again increasing, but only so as \nto require an hour or more at the pumps every day. You \nmust know that in a settled and civilised ocean like our \nAtlantic, for example, some skippers think little of pump- \ning their whole way across it ; though of a still, sleepy \nnight, should the officer of the deck happen to forget his \nduty in that respect, the probability would be that he \nand his shipmates would never again remember it, on \naccount of all hands gently subsiding to the bottom. Nor \nin the solitary and savage seas far from you to the west- \nward, gentlemen, is it altogether unusual for ships to \nkeep clanging at their pump-handles in full chorus even \nfor a voyage of considerable length ; that is, if it lie along \na tolerably accessible coast, or if any other reasonable \nretreat is afforded them. It is only when a leaky vessel \nis in some very out-of-the-way part of those waters, some \nreally landless latitude, that her captain begins to feel \na little anxious. \n\n' Much this way had it been with the Town-Ho \\ so \nwhen her leak was found gaining once more, there was \nin truth some small concern manifested by several of her \ncompany ; especially by Radney the mate. He com- \nmanded the upper sails to be well hoisted, sheeted home \nanew, and every way expanded to the breeze. Now this \nRadney, I suppose, was as little of a coward, and as little \ninclined to any sort of nervous apprehensiveness touching \nhis own person, as any fearless, unthinking creature on \nland or on sea that you can conveniently imagine, gentle- \n\n\n\nTHE TOWN-HO'S STORY 311 \n\nmen. Therefore when he betrayed this solicitude about \nthe safety of the ship, some of the seamen declared that \nit was only on account of his being a part owner in her. \nSo when they were working that evening at the pumps, \nthere was on this head no small gamesomeness slyly going \non among them, as they stood with their feet continually \noverflowed by the rippling clear water clear as any \nmountain spring, gentlemen that bubbling from the \npumps ran across the deck, and poured itself out in steady \nspouts at the lee scupper-holes. \n\n4 Now, as you well know, it is not seldom the case hi \nthis conventional world of ours watery or otherwise ; \nthat when a person placed in command over his fellow- \nmen finds one of them to be very significantly his superior \nin general pride of manhood, straightway against that \nman he conceives an unconquerable dislike and bitterness ; \nand if he have a chance he will pull down and pulverise that \nsubaltern's tower, and make a little heap of dust of it. \nBe this conceit of mine as it may, gentlemen, at all events \nSteelkilt was a tall and noble animal with a head like a \nRoman, and a flowing golden beard like the tasselled \nhousings of your last viceroy's snorting charger ; and a \nbrain, and a heart, and a soul in him, gentlemen, which \nhad made Steelkilt Charlemagne, had he been born son \nto Charlemagne's father. But Radney, the mate, was \nugly as a mule ; yet as hardy, as stubborn, as malicious. \nHe did not love Steelkilt, and Steelkilt knew it. \n\n' Espying the mate drawing near as he was toiling at \nthe pump with the rest, the Lakeman affected not to \nnotice him, but unawed, went on with his gay banterings. \n\n' \" Ay, ay, my merry lads, it 's a lively leak this ; \nhold a cannikin, one of ye, and let 's have a taste. By the \nLord, it 's worth bottling ! I tell ye what, men, old Rad's \ninvestment must go for it ! he had best cut away his part \nof the hull and tow it home. The fact is, boys, that sword- \n\n\n\n312 MOBY-DICK \n\nfish only began the job ; he 's come back again with a \ngang of ship-carpenters, saw-fish, and file-fish, and what \nnot ; and the whole posse of 'em are now hard at work \ncutting and slashing at the bottom ; making improve- \nments, I suppose. If old Rad were here now, I 'd tell \nhim to jump overboard and scatter 'em. They 're play- \ning the devil with his estate, I can tell him. But he 's a \nsimple old soul, Rad, and a beauty too. Boys, they say \nthe rest of his property is invested in looking-glasses. I \nwonder if he 'd give a poor devil like me the model of his \nnose.\" \n\n' \" Damn your eyes ! what 's that pump stopping f or ? \" \nroared Radney, pretending not to have heard the sailors' \ntalk. \" Thunder away at it ! \" \n\n\" Ay, ay, sir,\" said Steelkilt, merry as a cricket. \n\" Lively, boys, lively, now ! \" And with that the pump \nclanged like fifty fire-engines ; the men tossed their hats \noff to it, and ere long that peculiar gasping of the lungs \nwas heard which denotes the fullest tension of life's \nutmost energies. \n\n' Quitting the pump at last, with the rest of his band, \nthe Lakeman went forward all panting, and sat himself \ndown on the windlass ; his face fiery red, his eyes blood- \nshot, and wiping the profuse sweat from his brow. Now \nwhat cozening fiend it was, gentlemen, that possessed \nRadney to meddle with such a man in that corporeally \nexasperated state, I know not ; but so it happened. In- \ntolerably striding along the deck, the mate commanded \nhim to get a broom and sweep down the planks, and also \na shovel, and remove some offensive matters consequent \nupon allowing a pig to run at large. \n\n' Now, gentlemen, sweeping a ship's deck at sea is a \npiece of household work which in all times but raging \ngales is regularly attended to every evening ; it has been \nknown to be done in the case of ships actually foundering \n\n\n\nTHE TOWN-HO'S STORY 313 \n\nat the time. Such, gentlemen, is the inflexibility of sea- \nusages and the instinctive love of neatness in seamen ; \nsome of whom would not willingly drown without first \nwashing their faces. But in all vessels this broom business \nis the prescriptive province of the boys, if boys there be \naboard. Besides, it was the stronger men in the Town-Ho \nthat had been divided into gangs, taking turns at the \npumps ; and being the most athletic seaman of them all, \nSteelkilt had been regularly assigned captain of one of \nthe gangs ; consequently he should have been freed from \nany trivial business not connected with truly nautical \nduties, such being the case with his comrades. I mention \nall these particulars so that you may understand exactly \nhow this affair stood between the two men. \n\n' But there was more than this : the order about the \nshovel was almost as plainly meant to sting and insult \nSteelkilt, as though Radney had spat in his face. Any \nman who has gone sailor in a whale-ship will understand \nthis ; and all this and doubtless much more, the Lakeman \nfully comprehended when the mate uttered his command. \nBut as he sat still for a moment, and as he steadfastly \nlooked into the mate's malignant eye and perceived the \nstacks of powder-casks heaped up in him and the slow- \nmatch silently burning along toward them ; as he in- \nstinctively saw all this, that strange forbearance and un- \nwillingness to stir up the deeper passionateness in any \nalready ireful being a repugnance most felt, when felt \nat all, by really valiant men even when aggrieved this \nnameless phantom feeling, gentlemen, stole over Steelkilt. \n\n' Therefore, in his ordinary tone, only a little broken \nby the bodily exhaustion he was temporarily in, he an- \nswered him saying that sweeping the deck was not his \nbusiness, and he would not do it. And then, without at \nall alluding to the shovel, he pointed to three lads as the \ncustomary sweepers ; who, not being billeted at the \n\n\n\n314 MOBY-DICK \n\npumps, had done little or nothing all day. To this, \nRadney replied with an oath, in a most domineering and \noutrageous manner unconditionally reiterating his com- \nmand ; meanwhile advancing upon the still seated Lake- \nman, with an uplifted cooper's club hammer which he had \nsnatched from a cask near by. \n\n' Heated and irritated as he was by his spasmodic toil \nat the pumps, for all his first nameless feeling of forbear- \nance the sweating Steelkilt could but ill brook this bearing \nin the mate ; but somehow still smothering the conflagra- \ntion within him, without speaking he remained doggedly \nrooted to his seat, till at last the incensed Radney shook \nthe hammer within a few inches of his face, furiously \ncommanding him to do his bidding. \n\n4 Steelkilt rose, and slowly retreating round the wind- \nlass, steadily followed by the mate with his menacing \nhammer, deliberately repeated his intention not to obey. \nSeeing, however, that his forbearance had not the slightest \neffect, by an awful and unspeakable intimation with his \ntwisted hand he warned off the foolish and infatuated \nman ; but it was to no purpose. And in this way the \ntwo went once slowly round the windlass ; when, resolved \nat last no longer to retreat, bethinking him that he had \nnow forborne as much as comported with his humour, \nthe Lakeman paused on the hatches and thus spoke to \nthe officer : \n\n1 \" Mr. Radney, I will not obey you. Take that \nhammer away, or look to yourself.\" But the predestin- \nated mate coming still closer to him, where the Lakeman \nstood fixed, now shook the heavy hammer within an inch \nof his teeth ; meanwhile repeating a string of insufferable \nmaledictions. Retreating not the thousandth part of an \ninch ; stabbing him in the eye with the unflinching \nponiard of his glance, Steelkilt, clenching his right hand \nbehind him and creepingly drawing it back, told his perse- \n\n\n\nTHE TOWN-HO'S STORY 315 \n\ncutor that if the hammer but grazed his cheek he (Steel- \nkilt) would murder him. But, gentlemen, the fool had \nbeen branded for the slaughter by the gods. Immediately \nthe hammer touched the cheek ; the next instant the \nlower jaw of the mate was stove in his head ; he fell on \nthe hatch spouting blood like a whale. \n\n* Ere the cry could go aft Steelkilt was shaking one of \nthe backstays leading far aloft to where two of his com- \nrades were standing their mast-heads. They were both \nCanallers. \n\n' \" Canallers ! \" cried Don Pedro. \" We have seen \nmany whale -ships in our harbours, but never heard of \nyour Canallers. Pardon : who and what are they ? \" \n\n' \" Canallers, Don, are the boatmen belonging to our \ngrand Erie Canal. You must have heard of it.\" \n\n' \" Nay, Senor ; hereabouts in this dull, warm, most \nlazy, and hereditary land, we know but little of your \nvigorous North.\" \n\n' \" Ay ? Well then, Don, refill my cup. Your \nchicha 's very fine ; and ere proceeding further I will tell \nye what our Canallers are ; for such information may \nthrow side-light upon my story.\" \n\n4 For three hundred and sixty miles, gentlemen, through \nthe entire breadth of the state of New York ; through \nnumerous populous cities and most thriving villages ; \nthrough long, dismal, uninhabited swamps, and affluent, \ncultivated fields, unrivalled for fertility ; by billiard- \nroom and bar-room ; through the holy-of-holies of great \nforests ; on Roman arches over Indian rivers ; through \nsun and shade ; by happy hearts or broken ; through \nall the wide contrasting scenery of those noble Mohawk \ncounties ; and especially, by rows of snow-white chapels, \nwhose spires stand almost like milestones, flows one con- \ntinual stream of Venetianly corrupt and often lawless life. \nThere 's your true Ashantee, gentlemen ; there howl your \n\n\n\n316 MOBY-DICK \n\npagans ; where you ever find them, next door to you ; \nunder the long-flung shadow, and the snug patronising \nlee of churches. For by some curious fatality, as it is \noften noted of your metropolitan freebooters that they \never encamp around the halls of justice, so sinners, gentle- \nmen, most abound in holiest vicinities. \n\n4 \" Is that a friar passing ? \" said Don Pedro, looking \ndownward into the crowded plaza, with humorous \nconcern. \n\n' \" Well for our northern friend, Dame Isabella's In- \nquisition wanes in Lima,\" laughed Don Sebastian. \" Pro- \nceed, Senor.\" \n\n' \" A moment ! Pardon ! \" cried another of the com- \npany. \" In the name of all us Limeese, I but desire to \nexpress to you, sir sailor, that we have by no means over- \nlooked your delicacy in not substituting present Lima \nfor distant Venice in your corrupt comparison. Oh ! do \nnot bow and look surprised ; you know the proverb all \nalong this coast 'Corrupt as Lima.' It but bears out \nyour saying, too ; churches more plentiful than billiard- \ntables, and forever open and ' Corrupt as Lima.' So, \ntoo, Venice ; I have been there ; the holy city of the \nblessed evangelist, St. Mark ! St. Dominic, purge it ! \nYour cup ! Thanks : here I refill ; now, you pour out \nagain.\" \n\n1 Freely depicted in his own vocation, gentlemen, the \nCanaller would make a fine dramatic hero, so abundantly \nand picturesquely wicked is he. Like Mark Antony, for \ndays and days along his green-turfed, flowery Nile, he \nindolently floats, openly toying with his red-cheeked \nCleopatra, ripening his apricot thigh upon the sunny deck. \nBut ashore, all this effeminacy is dashed. The brigandish \nguise which the Canaller so proudly sports, his slouched \nand gaily -ribboned hat, betoken his grand features. A \nterror to the smiling innocence of the villages through \n\n\n\nTHE TOWN-HO'S STORY 317 \n\nwhich he floats ; his swart visage and bold swagger are \nnot unshunned in cities. Once a vagabond on his own \ncanal, I have received good turns from one of these \nCanallers ; I thank him heartily ; would fain be not \nungrateful ; but it is often one of the prime redeeming \nqualities of your man of violence, that at times he has \nas stiff an arm to back a poor stranger in a strait, as to \nplunder a wealthy one. In sum, gentlemen, what the \nwildness of this canal life is, is emphatically evinced by \nthis ; that our wild whale-fishery contains so many of \nits most finished graduates, and that scarce any race of \nmankind, except Sydney men, are so much distrusted by \nour whaling-captains. Nor does it at all diminish the \ncuriousness of this matter, that to many thousands of our \nrural boys and young men born along its line, the pro- \nbationary life of the Grand Canal furnishes the sole tran- \nsition between quietly reaping in a Christian corn-field, \nand recklessly ploughing the waters of the most barbaric \nseas. \n\n' \" I see ! I see ! \" impetuously exclaimed Don Pedro, \nspilling his chicha upon his silvery ruffles. \" No need to \ntravel ! The world 5 s one Lima. I had thought, now, \nthat at your temperate North the generations were cold \nand holy as the hills. But the story.\" \n\n' I left off, gentlemen, where the Lakeman shook the \nbackstay. Hardly had he done so, when he was sur- \nrounded by the three junior mates and the four har- \npooneers, who all crowded him to the deck. But sliding \ndown the ropes like baleful comets, the two Canallers \nrushed into the uproar, and sought to drag their man out \nof it toward the forecastle. Others of the sailors joined \nwith them in this attempt, and a twisted turmoil ensued ; \nwhile standing out of harm's way, the valiant captain \ndanced up and down with a whale-pike, calling upon his \nofficers to manhandle that atrocious scoundrel, and smoke \n\n\n\n318 MOBY-DICK \n\nhim along to the quarter-deck. At intervals, he ran close \nup to the revolving border of the confusion, and prying \ninto the heart of it with his pike, sought to prick out the \nobject of his resentment. But Steelkilt and his desper- \nadoes were too much for them all ; they succeeded in \ngaining the forecastle deck, where, hastily slewing about \nthree or four large casks in a line with the windlass, these \nsea-Parisians entrenched themselves behind the barricade. \n\n' \" Come out of that, ye pirates ! \" roared the captain, \nnow menacing them with a pistol in each hand, just \nbrought to him by the steward. \" Come out of that, ye \ncut -throats ! \" \n\n' Steelkilt leaped on the barricade, and striding up and \ndown there, defied the worst the pistols could do ; but \ngave the captain to understand distinctly, that his (Steel- \nkilt's) death would be the signal for a murderous mutiny \non the part of all hands. Fearing in his heart lest this \nmight prove but too true, the captain a little desisted, but \nstill commanded the insurgents instantly to return to \ntheir duty. \n\n' \" Will you promise not to touch us, if we do ? \" \ndemanded their ringleader. \n\n' \" Turn to ! turn to ! I make no promise ; to your \nduty ! Do you want to sink the ship, by knocking off \nat a time like this ? Turn to ! \" and he once more raised \na pistol. \n\n' \" Sink the ship ! \" cried Steelkilt. \" Ay, let her \nsink. Not a man of us turns to, unless you swear not to \nraise a rope-yarn against us. What say ye, men 1 \" \nturning to his comrades. A fierce cheer was their response. \n\n' The Lakeman now patrolled the barricade, all the \nwhile keeping his eye on the captain, and jerking out such \nsentences as these : \"It 's not our fault ; we didn't \nwant it ; I told him to take his hammer away ; it was \nboy 3 s business ; he might have known me before this ; \n\n\n\nTHE TOWN-HO'S STORY 319 \n\nI told him not to prick the buffalo ; I believe I have broken \na finger here against his cursed jaw ; ain't those mincing- \nknives down in the forecastle there, men ? look to those \nhandspikes, my hearties. Captain, by God, look to \nyourself ; say the word ; don't be a fool ; forget it all ; \nwe are ready to turn to ; treat us decently, and we 're \nyour men ; but we won't be flogged.\" \n\n' \" Turn to ! I make no promises, turn to, I say ! \" \n\n' \" Look ye, now,\" cried the Lake man, flinging out his \narm toward him, \" there are a few of us here (and I am \none of them) who have shipped for the cruise, d' ye see ; \nnow as you well know, sir, we can claim our discharge as \nsoon as the anchor is down ; so we don't want a row ; it 's \nnot our interest ; we want to be peaceable ; we are ready \nto work, but we won't be flogged.\" \n\n' \" Turn to ! \" roared the captain. \n\n* Steelkilt glanced round him a moment, and then \nsaid : \" I tell you what it is now, captain, rather than \nkill ye, and be hung for such a shabby rascal, we won't \nlift a hand against ye unless ye attack us ; but till you \nsay the word about not flogging us, we don't do a hand's \nturn.\" \n\n6 \" Down into the forecastle then, down with ye, I '11 \nkeep ye there till ye 're sick of it. Down ye go.\" \n\n' \" Shall we ? \" cried the ringleader to his men. Most \nof them were against it ; but at length, in obedience to \nSteelkilt, they preceded him down into their dark den, \ngrowlingly disappearing, like bears into a cave. \n\n' As the Lakeman's bare head was just level with the \nplanks, the captain and his posse leaped the barricade, \nand rapidly drawing over the slide of the scuttle, planted \ntheir group of hands upon it, and loudly called for the \nsteward to bring the heavy brass padlock belonging to the \ncompanion-way. Then opening the slide a little, the \ncaptain whispered something down the crack, closed it, \n\n\n\n320 MOBY-DICK \n\nand turned the key upon them ten in number leaving \non deck some twenty or more, who thus far had remained \nneutral. \n\n' All night a wide-awake watch was kept by all the \nofficers, forward and aft, especially about the forecastle \nscuttle and fore-hatchway : at which last place it was \nfeared the insurgents might emerge, after breaking through \nthe bulkhead below. But the hours of darkness passed \nin peace ; the men who still remained at their duty toiling \nhard at the pumps, whose clinking and clanking at inter- \nvals through the dreary night dismally resounded through \nthe ship. \n\n' At sunrise the captain went forward, and knocking \non the deck, summoned the prisoners to work ; but with \na yell they refused. Water was then lowered down to \nthem, and a couple of handfuls of biscuit were tossed after \nit ; when again turning the key upon them and pocketing \nit, the captain returned to the quarter-deck. Twice \nevery day for three days this was repeated ; but on the \nfourth morning a confused wrangling, and then a scuffling \nwas heard, as the customary summons was delivered ; \nand suddenly four men burst up from the forecastle, \nsaying they were ready to turn to. The fetid closeness \nof the ah*, and a famishing diet, united perhaps to some \nfears of ultimate retribution, had constrained them to \nsurrender at discretion. Emboldened by this, the captain \nreiterated his demand to the rest, but Steelkilt shouted \nup to him a terrific hint to stop his babbling and betake \nhimself where he belonged. On the fifth morning three \nothers of the mutineers bolted up into the air from the \ndesperate arms below that sought to restrain them. \nOnly three were left. \n\n' \" Better turn to, now ? \" said the captain, with a \nheartless jeer. \n\n' \" Shut us up again, will ye ! \" cried Steelkilt. \n\n\n\nTHE TOWN-HO'S STORY 321 \n\n4 \" Oh ! certainly,\" said the captain, and the key clicked. \n\n' It was at this point, gentlemen, that enraged by the \ndefection of seven of his former associates, and stung by the \nmocking voice that had last hailed him, and maddened \nby his long entombment in a place as black as the bowels \nof despair ; it was then that Steelkilt proposed to the two \nCanallers, thus far apparently of one mind with him, to \nburst out of their hole at the next summoning of the \ngarrison ; and armed with their keen mincing-knives \n(long, crescentic, heavy implements with a handle at each \nend) run amuck from the bowsprit to the taffrail ; and if \nby any devilishness of desperation possible, seize the ship. \nFor himself, he would do this, he said, whether they joined \nhim or not. That was the last night he should spend in \nthat den. But the scheme met with no opposition on \nthe part of the other two ; they swore they were ready for \nthat, or for any other mad thing, for anything in short \nbut a surrender. And what was more, they each insisted \nupon being the first man on deck, when the time to make \nthe rush should come. But to this their leader as fiercely \nobjected, reserving that priority for himself ; particularly \nas his two comrades would not yield, the one to the other, \nin the matter ; and both of them could not be first, for \nthe ladder would but admit one man at a time. And \nhere, gentlemen, the foul play of these miscreants must \ncome out. \n\n' Upon hearing the frantic project of their leader, each \nin his own separate soul had suddenly lighted, it would \nseem, upon the same piece of treachery, namely : to be \nforemost in breaking out, in order to be the first of the \nthree, though the last of the ten, to surrender ; and there- \nby secure whatever small chance of pardon such conduct \nmight merit. But when Steelkilt made known his deter- \nmination still to lead them to the last, they in some way, by \nsome subtle chemistry of villainy, mixed their before secret \n\nVOL. i, x \n\n\n\n322 MOBY-DICK \n\ntreacheries together ; and when their leader fell into a \ndoze, verbally opened their souls to each other in three \nsentences ; and bound the sleeper with cords, and gagged \nhim with cords ; and shrieked out for the captain at \nmidnight. \n\n' Thinking murder at hand, and smelling in the dark \nfor the blood, he and all his armed mates and harpooneers \nrushed for the forecastle. In a few minutes the scuttle \nwas opened, and, bound hand and foot, the still struggling \nringleader was shoved up into the air by his perfidious \nallies, who at once claimed the honour of securing a man \nwho had been fully ripe for murder. But all these were \ncollared, and dragged along the deck like dead cattle ; and, \nside by side, were seized up into the mizen rigging, like \nthree quarters of meat, and there they hung till morning. \n\" Damn ye,\" cried the captain, pacing to and fro before \nthem, \" the vultures would not touch ye, ye villains ! \" \n\n' At sunrise he summoned all hands ; and separating \nthose who had rebelled from those who had taken no \npart in the mutiny, he told the former that he had a good \nmind to flog them all round thought, upon the whole, \nhe would do so he ought to justice demanded it ; but \nfor the present, considering their timely surrender, he \nwould let them go with a reprimand, which he accordingly \nadministered in the vernacular. \n\n' \" But as for you, ye carrion rogues,\" turning to the \nthree men in the rigging \" for you, I mean to mince ye \nup for the try -pots \" ; and, seizing a rope, he applied it \nwith all his might to the backs of the two traitors, till \nthey yelled no more, but lifelessly hung their heads side- \nways, as the two crucified thieves are drawn. \n\n4 \" My wrist is sprained with ye ! \" he cried, at last ; \n\" but there is still rope enough left for you, my fine \nbantam, that wouldn't give up. Take that gag from his \nmouth, and let us hear what he can say for himself.\" \n\n\n\nTHE TOWN-HO'S STORY 323 \n\n' For a moment the exhausted mutineer made a tremu- \nlous motion of his cramped jaws, and then painfully \ntwisting round his head, said in a sort of hiss, \" What I \nsay is this and mind it well if you flog me, I murder \nyou ! \" \n\n' \" Say ye so ? then see how ye frighten me \" and \nthe captain drew off with the rope to strike. \n\n' \" Best not,\" hissed the Lakeman. \n\n' \" But I must,\" and the rope was once more drawn \nback for the stroke. \n\n* Steelkilt here hissed out something, inaudible to all \nbut the captain ; who, to the amazement of all hands, \nstarted back, paced the deck rapidly two or three times, \nand then suddenly throwing down his rope, said, \" I won't \ndo it let him go cut him down : d' ye hear ? \" \n\n' But as the junior mates were hurrying to execute the \norder, a pale man, with a bandaged head, arrested them \nRadney the chief mate. Ever since the blow, he had \nlain in his berth ; but that morning, hearing the tumult \non the deck, he had crept out, and thus far had watched \nthe whole scene. Such was the state of his mouth, that \nhe could hardly speak ; but mumbling something about \nhis being willing and able to do what the captain dared not \nattempt, he snatched the rope and advanced to his pinioned \nfoe. \n\n* \" You are a coward ! \" hissed the Lakeman. \n\n' \" So I am, but take that.\" The mate was in the very \nact of striking, when another hiss stayed his uplifted arm. \nHe paused : and then pausing no more, made good his \nword, spite of Steelkilt 's threat, whatever that might have \nbeen. The three men were then cut down, all hands were \nturned to, and, sullenly worked by the moody seamen, the \niron pumps clanged as before. \n\n' Just after dark that day, when one watch had retired \nbelow, a clamour was heard in the forecastle : and the \n\n\n\n324 MOBY-DICK \n\ntwo trembling traitors running up, besieged the cabin \ndoor, saying they durst not consort with the crew. En- \ntreaties, cuffs, and kicks could not drive them back, so \nat their own instance they were put down in the ship's run \nfor salvation. Still, no sign of mutiny reappeared among \nthe rest. On the contrary, it seemed, that mainly at \nSteelkilt's instigation, they had resolved to maintain \nthe strictest peacefulness, obey all orders to the last, and, \nwhen the ship reached port, desert her in a body. But in \norder to ensure the speediest end to the voyage, they all \nagreed to another thing namely, not to sing out for \nwhales, in case any should be discovered. For, spite of \nher leak, and spite of all her other perils, the Town-Ho \nstill maintained her mast-heads, and her captain was just \nas willing to lower for a fish that moment, as on the day \nhis craft first struck the cruising -ground ; and Radney \nthe mate was quite as ready to change his berth for a boat, \nand with his bandaged mouth seek to gag in death the \nvital jaw of the whale. \n\n' But though the Lakeman had induced the seamen to \nadopt this sort of passiveness in their conduct, he kept \nhis own counsel (at least till all was over) concerning his \nown proper and private revenge upon the man who had \nstung him in the ventricles of his heart. He was in \nRadney the chief mate's watch ; and as if the infatuated \nman sought to run more than half-way to meet his doom, \nafter the scene at the rigging, he insisted, against the \nexpress counsel of the captain, upon resuming the head \nof his watch at night. Upon this, and one or two other \ncircumstances, Steelkilt systematically built the plan of his \nrevenge. \n\n' During the night, Radney had an unseamanlike way \nof sitting on the bulwarks of the quarter-deck, and leaning \nhis arm upon the gunwale of the boat which was hoisted \nup there, a little above the ship's side. In this attitude, \n\n\n\nTHE TOWN-HO'S STORY 325 \n\nit was well known, he sometimes dozed. There was a \nconsiderable vacancy between the boat and the ship, and \ndown between this was the sea. Steelkilt calculated his \ntime, and found that his next trick at the helm would \ncome round at two o'clock, in the morning of the third \nday from that in which he had been betrayed. At his \nleisure, he employed the interval in braiding something \nvery carefully in his watches below. \n\n' \" What are you making there ? \" said a shipmate. \n\nc \" What do you think ? what does it look like ? \" \n\n' \" Like a lanyard for your bag ; but it 's an odd one, \nseems to me.\" \n\n' \" Yes, rather oddish,\" said the Lakeman, holding it \nat arm's length before him ; \" but I think it will answer. \nShipmate, I haven't enough twine, have you any ? \" \n\n' But there was none in the forecastle. \n\n' \" Then I must get some from old Had \" ; and he rose \nto go aft. \n\n' \" You don't mean to go a-begging to him I \" said a \nsailor. \n\n' \" Why not ? Do you think he won't do me a turn, \nwhen it 's to help himself in the end, shipmate ? \" and \ngoing to the mate, he looked at him quietly, and asked \nhim for some twine to mend his hammock. It was given \nhim neither twine nor lanyard were seen again ; but \nthe next night an iron ball, closely netted, partly rolled \nfrom the pocket of the Lakeman's monkey-jacket, as he \nwas tucking the coat into his hammock for a pillow. \nTwenty-four hours after, his trick at the silent helm \nnigh to the man who was apt to doze over the grave always \nready dug to the seaman's hand that fatal hour was then \nto come ; and in the fore -ordaining soul of Steelkilt, the \nmate was already stark and stretched as a corpse, with his \nforehead crushed in. \n\n4 But, gentlemen, a fool saved the would-be murderer \n\n\n\n326 MOBY-DICK \n\nfrom the bloody deed he had planned. Yet complete \nrevenge he had, and without being the avenger. For by \na mysterious fatality, Heaven itself seemed to step in to \ntake out of his hands into its own the damning thing he \nwould have done. \n\n1 It was just between daybreak and sunrise of the \nmorning of the second day, when they were washing down \nthe decks, that a stupid Teneriffe man, drawing water in \nthe main-chains, all at once shouted out, \" There she rolls ! \nthere she rolls ! \" Jesu, what a whale ! It was Mahv^JQick. \n\n4 \" Moby-Dick ! \" cried Don Sebastian ; \" St. Dominic ! \nsir sailor, but do whales have christenings ? Whom call \nyou Moby-Dick ? \" \n\n4 \" A very white, and famous, and most deadly immortal \nmonster, Don ; but that would be too long a story.\" \n\n4 \" How ? how ? \" cried all the young Spaniards, \ncrowding. \n\n' \" Nay, Dons, Dons nay, nay ! I cannot rehearse \nthat now. Let me get more into the air, sirs.\" \n\n4 \" Chicha ! the chicha ! \" cried Don Pedro ; \" our \nvigorous friend looks faint ; fill up his empty glass ! \" \n\n4 No need, gentlemen ; one moment, and I proceed. \nNow, gentlemen, so suddenly perceiving the snowy whale \nwithin fifty yards of the ship forgetful of the compact \namong the crew in the excitement of the moment, the \nTeneriffe man had instinctively and involuntarily lifted \nhis voice for the monster, though for some little time past \nit had been plainly beheld from the three sullen mast-heads. \nAll was now a frenzy. \" The White Whale the White \nWhale ! \" was the cry from captain, mates, and har- \npooneers, who, undeterred by fearful rumours, were all \nanxious to capture so famous and precious a fish ; while \nthe dogged crew eyed askance, and with curses, the appal- \nling beauty of the vast milky mass, that lit up by a hori- \nzontal spangling sun, shifted and glistened like a living \n\n\n\nTHE TOWN-HO'S STORY 327 \n\nopal in the blue morning sea. Gentlemen, a strange \nfatality pervades the whole career of these events, as if \nverily mapped out before the world itself was charted. \nThe mutineer was the bowsman of the mate, and when \nfast to a fish, it was his duty to sit next him, while Radney \nstood up with his lance in the prow, and haul in or slacken \nthe line, at the word of command. Moreover, when the \nfour boats were lowered, the mate's got the start ; and \nnone howled more fiercely with delight than did Steelkilt, \nas he strained at his oar. After a stiff pull, their har- \npooneer got fast, and, spear in hand, Radney sprang to \nthe bow. He was always a furious man, it seems, in a \nboat. And now his bandaged cry was, to beach him \non the whale's topmost back. Nothing loath, his bows- \nman hauled him up and up, through a blinding foam that \nblent two whitenesses together ; till of a sudden the boat \nstruck as against a sunken ledge, and keeling over, spilled \nout the standing mate. That instant, as he fell on the \nwhale's slippery back, the boat righted, and was dashed \naside by the swell, while Radney was tossed over into the \nsea, on the other flank of the whale . He struck out through \nthe spray, and, for an instant, was dimly seen through \nthat veil, wildly seeking to remove himself from the eye \nof Moby-Dick. But the whale rushed round in a sudden \nmaelstrom ; seized the swimmer between his jaws ; and \nrearing high up with him, plunged headlong again, and \nwent down. \n\n' Meantime, at the first tap of the boat's bottom, the \nLakeman had slackened the line, so as to drop astern from \nthe whirlpool ; calmly looking on, he thought his own \nthoughts. But a sudden, terrific, downward jerking \nof the boat, quickly brought his knife to the line. He \ncut it ; and the whale was free. But, at some distance, \nMoby-Dick rose again, with some tatters of Radney 's \nred woollen shirt caught in the teeth that had destroyed \n\n\n\n328 MOBY-DICK \n\nhim. All four boats gave chase again ; but the whale \neluded them, and finally wholly disappeared. \n\n' In good time, the Town-Ho reached her port a savage, \nsolitary place where no civilised creature resided. \nThere, headed by the Lake man, all but five or six of the \nforemast-men deliberately deserted among the palms ; \neventually, as it turned out, seizing a large double war- \ncanoe of the savages, and setting sail for some other \nharbour. \n\n4 The ship's company being reduced to but a handful, \nthe captain called upon the Islanders to assist him in the \nlaborious business of heaving down the ship to stop the \nleak. But to such unresting vigilance over their danger- \nous allies was this small band of whites necessitated, both \nby night and by day, and so extreme was the hard work \nthey underwent, that upon the vessel being ready again \nfor sea, they were in such a weakened condition that the \ncaptain durst not put off with them in so heavy a vessel. \nAfter taking counsel with his officers, he anchored the \nship as far off shore as possible ; loaded and ran out his \ntwo cannon from the bows ; stacked his muskets on the \npoop ; and warning the Islanders not to approach the \nship at their peril, took one man with him, and setting \nthe sail of his best whale-boat, steered straight before the \nwind for Tahiti, five hundred miles distant, to procure \na reinforcement to his crew. \n\n' On the fourth day of the sail, a large canoe was \ndescried, which seemed to have touched at a low isle of \ncorals. He steered away from it ; but the savage craft \nbore down on him ; and soon the voice of Steelkilt hailed \nhim to heave to, or he would run him under water. The \ncaptain presented a pistol. With one foot on each prow \nof the yoked war-canoes, the Lakeman laughed him to \nscorn ; assuring him that if the pistol so much as clicked \nin the lock, he would bury him in bubbles and foam. \n\n\n\nTHE TOWN-HO'S STORY 329 \n\n' \" What do you want of me ? \" cried the captain. \n\n' \" Where are you bound ? and for what are you \nbound ? \" demanded Steelkilt ; \"no lies.\" \n\n' \" I am bound to Tahiti for more men.\" \n\n' \" Very good. Let me board you a moment I come \nin peace.\" With that he leaped from the canoe, swam to \nthe boat ; and climbing the gunwale, stood face to face \nwith the captain. \n\n\" Cross your arms, sir ; throw back your head. Now, \nrepeat after me. As soon as Steelkilt leaves me, I swear \nto beach this boat on yonder island, and remain there six \ndays. If I do not, may lightnings strike me ! \" \n\n' \" A pretty scholar,\" laughed the Lakeman. \" Adios, \nSenor ! \" and leaping into the sea, he swam back to his \ncomrades. \n\n' Watching the boat till it was fairly beached, and \ndrawn up to the roots of the cocoa-nut trees, Steelkilt \nmade sail again, and in due time arrived at Tahiti, his \nown place of destination. There, luck befriended him ; \ntwo ships were about to sail for France, and were provi- \ndentially in want of precisely that number of men which \nthe sailor headed. They embarked ; and so forever got \nthe start of their former captain, had he been at all minded \nto work them legal retribution. \n\n' Some ten days after the French ships sailed, the whale- \nboat arrived, and the captain was forced to enlist some of \nthe more civilised Tahitians, who had been somewhat \nused to the sea. Chartering a small native schooner, he \nreturned with them to his vessel ; and finding all right \nthere, again resumed his cruisings. \n\n' Where Steelkilt now is, gentlemen, none know ; but \nupon the island of Nantucket, the widow of Radney still \nturns to the sea which refuses to give up its dead ; still \nin dreams sees the awful White Whale that destroyed \nhim. * * * \n\n\n\n330 MOBY-DICK \n\n' \" Are you through ? \" said Don Sebastian quietly. \n\n1 \" I am, Don.\" \n\n6 \" Then I entreat you, tell me if to the best of your \nown convictions, this your story is in substance really \ntrue ? It is so passing wonderful ! Did you get it from an \nunquestionable source ? Bear with me if I seem to press.\" \n\n' \" Also bear with all of us, sir sailor ; for we all join \nin Don Sebastian's suit,\" cried the company, with exceed- \ning interest. \n\n' \" Is there a copy of the Holy Evangelists hi the Golden \nInn, gentlemen ? \" \n\n' \" Nay,\" said Don Sebastian ; \" but I know a worthy \npriest near by, who will quickly procure one for me. I \ngo for it ; but are you well advised ? this may grow too \nserious.\" \n\n' \" Will you be so good as to bring the priest also, Don ? \" \n\n' \" Though there are no Auto-da-Fes in Lima now,\" \nsaid one of the company to another ; \"I fear our sailor \nfriend runs risk of the archiepiscopacy. Let us withdraw \nmore out of the moonlight. I see no need of this.\" \n\n' \" Excuse me for running after you, Don Sebastian ; \nbut may I also beg that you will be particular in procuring \n\nthe largest -sized Evangelists you can.\" \n\n******* \n\n' \" This is the priest, he brings you the Evangelists,\" \nsaid Don Sebastian gravely, returning with a tall and \nsolemn figure. \n\n' \" Let me remove my hat. Now, venerable priest, \nfurther into the light, and hold the Holy Book before me \nthat I may touch it. \n\n' \" So help me Heaven, and on my honour the story I \nhave told ye, gentlemen, is in substance and its great \nitems, true. I know it to be true ; it happened on this \nball ; I trod the ship ; I knew the crew ; I have seen and \ntalked with Steelkilt since the death of Radney.\" \n\n\n\nCHAPTER LV \n\nOF THE MONSTROUS PICTURES OF WHALES \n\nI SHALL ere long paint to you as well as one can without \ncanvas, something like the true form of the whale as he \nactually appears to the eye of the whaleman when in his \nown absolute body the whale is moored alongside the \nwhale -ship so that he can be fairly stepped upon there. \nIt may be worth while, therefore, previously to advert \nto those curious imaginary portraits of him which even \ndown to the present day confidently challenge the faith \nof the landsman. It is time to set the world right in \nthis matter, by proving such pictures of the whale all \nwrong. \n\nIt may be that the primal source of all those pictorial \ndelusions will be found among the oldest Hindu, Egyptian, \nand Grecian sculptures. For ever since those inventive \nbut unscrupulous times when on the marble panellings \nof temples, the pedestals of statues, and on shields, \nmedallions, cups, and coins, the dolphin was drawn in \nscales of chain-armour like Saladin's, and a helmeted \nhead like St. George's ; ever since then has something \nof the same sort of licence prevailed, not only in most \npopular pictures of the whale, but in many scientific \npresentations of him. \n\nNow, by all odds, the most ancient extant portrait \nanyways purporting to be the whale's, is to be found in \nthe famous cavern -pagoda of Elephanta, in India. The \nBrahmins maintain that in the almost endless sculptures \nof that immemorial pagoda, all the trades and pursuits, \n\n331 \n\n\n\n332 MOBY-DICK \n\nevery conceivable avocation of man, were prefigured ages \nbefore any of them actually came into being. No wonder, \nthen, that in some sort our noble profession of whaling \nshould have been there shadowed forth. The Hindu \nwhale referred to, occurs in a separate department of the \nwall, depicting the incarnation of Vishnu in the form of \nleviathan, learnedly known as the Matse Avatar. But \nthough this sculpture is half man and half whale, so as \nonly to give the tail of the latter, yet that small section \nof him is all wrong. It looks more like the tapering tail \nof an anaconda a than the broad palms of the true whale's \nmajestic flukes. \n\nBut go to the old galleries, and look now at a great \nChristian painter's portrait of this fish ; for he succeeds \nno better than the antediluvian Hindu. It is Guide's \npicture of Perseus rescuing Andromeda from the sea- \nmonster or whale. Where did Guido get the model of \nsuch a strange creature as that ? Nor does Hogarth, in \npainting the same scene in his own ' Perseus Descending,' \nmake out one whit better. The huge corpulence of that \nHogarthian monster undulates on the surface, scarcely \ndrawing one inch of water. It has a sort of howdah on its \nback, and its distended tusked mouth into which the \nbillows are rolling, might be taken for the Traitors' Gate \nleading from the Thames by water into the Tower. Then, \nthere are the Prodromus whales of old Scotch Sibbald, \nand Jonah's whale, as depicted in the prints of old Bibles \nand the cuts of old primers. What shall be said of these ? \nAs for the bookbinder's whale winding like a vine-stalk \nround the stock of a descending anchor as stamped and \ngilded on the backs and title-pages of many books both \nold and new that is a very picturesque but purely \nfabulous creature, imitated, I take it, from the like figures \non antique vases. Though universally denominated a \ndolphin, I nevertheless call this bookbinder's fish an \n\n\n\nMONSTROUS PICTURES OF WHALES 333 \n\nattempt at a whale ; because it was so intended when the \ndevice was first introduced. It was introduced by an old \nItalian publisher somewhere about the 15th century, \nduring the Revival of Learning ; and in those days, and \neven down to a comparatively late period, dolphins were \npopularly supposed to be a species of the leviathan. \n\nIn the vignettes and other embellishments of some \nancient books you will at times meet with very curious \ntouches at the whale, where all manner of spouts, jets \nd'eau, hot springs and cold, Saratoga and Baden-Baden, \ncome bubbling up from his unexhausted brain. In the \ntitle-page of the original edition of the Advancement of \nLearning you will find some curious whales. \n\nBut quitting all these unprofessional attempts, let us \nglance at those pictures of leviathan purporting to be \nsober, scientific delineations, by those who know. In \nold Harris's collection of voyages there are some plates \nof whales extracted from a Dutch book of voyages, A.D. \n1671, entitled A Whaling Voyage to Spitzbergen in the ship \nJonas in the Whale, Peter Peterson of Friesland, master. \nIn one of those plates the whales, like great rafts of \nlogs, are represented lying among ice-isles, with white \nbears running over their living backs. In another \nplate, the prodigious blunder is made of representing \nthe whale with perpendicular flukes. \n\nThen again, there is an imposing quarto, written by one \nCaptain Colnett, a post-captain in the English navy, \nentitled A Voyage round Cape Horn into the South Seas, \nfor the purpose of extending the Spermaceti Whale Fisheries. \nIn this book is an outline purporting to be a ' Picture of a \nPhyseter or Spermaceti whale, drawn by scale from one \nkilled on the coast of Mexico, August 1793, and hoisted \non deck.' I doubt not the captain had this veracious \npicture taken for the benefit of his marines. To mention \nbut one thing about it, let me say that it has an eye which \n\n\n\n334 MOBY-DICK \n\napplied, according to the accompanying scale, to a full- \ngrown sperm whale, would make the eye of that whale a \nbow- window some five feet long. Ah, my gallant cap- \ntain, why did ye not give us Jonah looking out of that eye ! \n\nNor are the most conscientious compilations of Natural \nHistory for the benefit of the young and tender, free from \nthe same heinousness of mistake. Look at that popular \nwork Goldsmith's Animated Nature. In the abridged \nLondon edition of 1807, there are plates of an alleged \n'whale' and a 'narwhale.' I do not wish to seem \ninelegant, but this unsightly whale looks much like an \namputated sow ; and, as for the nar whale, one glimpse at \nit is enough to amaze one, that in this nineteenth century \nsuch a hippogrrff could be palmed for genuine upon any \nintelligent public of schoolboys. \n\nThen, again, in 1825, Bernard Germain, Count de Lace- \npede, a great naturalist, published a scientific systematised \nwhale book, wherein are several pictures of the different \nspecies of the leviathan. All these are not only incorrect, \nbut the picture of the Mysticetus or Greenland whale \n(that is to say, the right whale), even Scoresby, a long- \nexperienced man as touching that species, declares not \nto have its counterpart in nature. \n\nBut the placing of the cap -sheaf to all this blundering \nbusiness was reserved for the scientific Frederick Cuvier, \nbrother to the famous Baron. In 1836, he published a \nNatural History of Whales, in which he gives what he \ncalls a picture of the sperm whale. Before showing that \npicture to any Nantucketer, you had best provide for \nyour summary retreat from Nantucket. In a word, \nFrederick Cuvier's sperm whale is not a sperm whale, \nbut a squash. Of course, he never had the benefit of a \nwhaling voyage (such men seldom have), but whence he \nderived that picture, who can tell ? Perhaps he got it \nas his scientific predecessor in the same field, Desmarest, \n\n\n\nMONSTROUS PICTURES OF WHALES 335 \n\ngot one of his authentic abortions ; that is, from a Chinese \ndrawing. And what sort of lively lads with the pencil \nthose Chinese are, many queer cups and saucers inform us. \n\nAs for the sign-painters' whales seen in the streets \nhanging over the shops of oil-dealers, what shall be said \nof them ? They are generally Richard in. whales, with \ndromedary humps, and very savage ; breakfasting on \nthree or four sailor tarts, that is whale-boats full of \nmariners : their deformities floundering in seas of blood \nand blue paint. \n\nBut these manifold mistakes in depicting the whale are \nnot so very surprising after all. Consider ! Most of the \nscientific drawings have been taken from the stranded \nfish ; and these are about as correct as a drawing of a \nwrecked ship, with broken back, would correctly repre- \nsent the noble animal itself in all its undashed pride of \nhull and spars. Though elephants have stood for their \nfull-lengths, the living leviathan has never yet fairly \nfloated himself for his portrait. The living whale, in his \nfull majesty and significance, is only to be seen at sea in \nunfathomable waters ; and afloat the vast bulk of him \nis out of sight, like a launched line-of-battle ship ; and \nout of that element it is a thing eternally impossible for \nmortal man to hoist him bodily into the air, so as to \npreserve all his mighty swells and undulations. And, \nnot to speak of the highly presumable difference of con- \ntour between a young sucking whale and a full-grown \nPlatonian leviathan ; yet, even in the case of one of those \nyoung sucking whales hoisted to a ship's deck, such is \nthen the outlandish, eel-like, limbered, varying shape of \nhim, that his precise expression the devil himself could \nnot catch. \n\nBut it may be fancied, that from the naked skeleton \nof the stranded whale, accurate hints may be derived \ntouching his true form. Not at all. For it is one of the \n\n\n\n336 MOBY-DICK \n\nmore curious things about this leviathan, that his skele- \nton gives very little idea of his general shape. Though \nJeremy Bentham's skeleton, which hangs for candelabra \nin the library of one of his executors, correctly conveys \nthe idea of a burly -browed utilitarian old gentleman, with \nall Jeremy's other leading personal characteristics ; yet \nnothing of this kind could be inferred from any leviathan's \narticulated bones. In fact, as the great Hunter says, the \nmere skeleton of the whale bears the same relation to the \nfully invested and padded animal as the insect does to \nthe chrysalis that so roundingly envelops it. This peculi- \narity is strikingly evinced in the head, as in some part of \nthis book will be incidentally shown. It is also very \ncuriously displayed in the side fin, the bones of which \nalmost exactly answer to the bones of the human hand, \nminus only the thumb. This fin has four regular bone- \nfingers, the index, middle, ring, and little finger. But all \nthese are permanently lodged in their fleshy covering, \nas the human fingers in an artificial covering. ' However \nrecklessly the whale may sometimes serve us/ said \nhumorous Stubb one day, ' he can never be truly said to \nhandle us without mittens.' \n\nFor all these reasons, then, any way you may look at it, \nyou must needs conclude that the great leviathan is that \none creature in the world which must remain unpainted \nto the last. True, one portrait may hit the mark much \nnearer than another, but none can hit it with any very \nconsiderable degree of exactness. So there is no earthly \nway of finding out precisely what the whale really looks \nlike. And the only mode in which you can derive even \na tolerable idea of his living contour, is by going a-whaling \nyourself ; but by so doing, you run no small risk of being \neternally stove and sunk by him. Wherefore, it seems to \nme you had best not be too fastidious in your curiosity \ntouching this leviathan. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER LVI \n\nOF THE LESS ERRONEOUS PICTURES OF WHALES, AND THE \nTRUE PICTURES OF WHALING SCENES \n\nIN connection with the monstrous pictures of whales, I \nam strongly tempted here to enter upon those still more \nmonstrous stories of them which are to be found in certain \nbooks, both ancient and modern, especially hi Pliny, \nPurchas, Hakluyt, Harris, Cuvier, etc. But I pass that \nmatter by. \n\nI know of only four published outlines of the great \nsperm whale : Colnett's, Huggins's, Frederick Cuvier 's, \nand Beale's. In the previous chapter Colnett and Cuvier \nhave been referred to. Huggins's is far better than theirs ; \nbut, by great odds, Beale's is the best. All Beale's draw- \nings of this whale are good, excepting the middle figure \nin the picture of three whales in various attitudes, capping \nhis second chapter. His frontispiece, boats attacking \nsperm whales, though no doubt calculated to excite the \ncivil scepticism of some parlour men, is admirably correct \nand lifelike in its general effect. Some of the sperm \nwhale drawings in J. Ross Browne are pretty correct in \ncontour ; but they are wretchedly engraved. That is \nnot his fault, though. \n\nOf the right whale, the best outline pictures are in \nScoresby ; but they are drawn on too small a scale to \nconvey a desirable impression. He has but one picture \nof whaling scenes, and this is a sad deficiency, because it \nis by such pictures only, when at all well done, that you \n\nVOL. I. Y \n\n\n\n338 MOBY-DICK \n\ncan derive anything like a truthful idea of the living whale \nas seen by his living hunters. \n\nBut, taken for all in all, by far the finest, though in some \ndetails not the most correct, presentations of whales and \nwhaling scenes to be anywhere found, are two large \nFrench engravings, well executed, and taken from paint- \nings by one Garnery. Respectively, they represent \nattacks on the sperm and right whale. In the first en- \ngraving a noble sperm whale is depicted in full majesty \nof might, just risen beneath the boat from the profundities \nof the ocean, and bearing high in the air upon his back the \nterrific wreck of the stoven planks. The prow of the boat \nis partially unbroken, and is drawn just balancing upon \nthe monster's spine ; and standing in that prow, for that \none single incomputable flash of time, you behold an oars- \nman, half shrouded by the incensed boiling spout of the \nwhale, and in the act of leaping, as if from a precipice. \nThe action of the whole thing is wonderfully good and true. \nThe half -emptied line-tub floats on the whitened sea ; the \nwooden poles of the spilled harpoons obliquely bob in it ; \nthe heads of the swimming crew are scattered about the \nwhale in contrasting expressions of affright ; while hi the \nblack stormy distance the ship is bearing down upon the \nscene. Serious fault might be found with the anatomical \ndetails of this whale, but let that pass ; since, for the life \nof me, I could not draw so good a one. \n\nIn the second engraving, the boat is in the act of draw- \ning alongside the barnacled flank of a large running right \nwhale, that rolls his black weedy bulk in the sea like some \nmossy rock-slide from the Patagonian cliffs. His jets \nare erect, full, and black like soot ; so that from so \nabounding a smoke in the chimney, you would think there \nmust be a brave supper cooking in the great bowels below. \nSea-fowls are pecking at the small crabs, shell-fish, and \nother sea-candies and macaroni, which the right whale \n\n\n\nLESS ERRONEOUS PICTURES 339 \n\nsometimes carries on his pestilent back. And all the \nwhile the thick-lipped leviathan is rushing through the \ndeep, leaving tons of tumultuous white curds in his wake, \nand causing the slight boat to rock in the swells like a \nskiff caught nigh the paddle-wheels of an ocean steamer. \nThus, the foreground is all raging commotion ; but \nbehind, in admirable artistic contrast, is the glassy \nlevel of a sea becalmed, the drooping unstarched sails \nof the powerless ship, and the inert mass of a dead \nwhale, a conquered fortress, with the flag of capture \nlazily hanging from the whale-pole inserted into his \nspout -hole. \n\nWho Garnery the painter is, or was, I know not. But \nmy life for it he was either practically conversant with his \nsubject, or else marvellously tutored by some experienced \nwhaleman. The French are the lads for painting action. \nGo and gaze upon all the paintings of Europe, and where \nwill you find such a gallery of living and breathing com- \nmotion on canvas, as in that triumphal hall at Versailles ; \nwhere the beholder fights his way, pell-mell, through the \nconsecutive great battles of France ; where every sword \nseems a flash of the Northern Lights, and the successive \narmed kings and emperors dash by, like a charge of \ncrowned centaurs ? Not wholly unworthy of a place in \nthat gallery, are those sea-battle pieces of Garnery. \n\nThe natural aptitude of the French for seizing the \npicturesqueness of things seems to be peculiarly evinced \nin what paintings and engravings they have of their \nwhaling scenes. With not one tenth of England's experi- \nence in the fishery, and not the thousandth part of that \nof the Americans, they have nevertheless furnished both \nnations with the only finished sketches at all capable \nof conveying the real spirit of the whale-hunt. For the \nmost part, the English and American whale draughtsmen \nseem entirely content with presenting the mechanical \n\n\n\n340 MOBY-DICK \n\noutline of things, such as the vacant profile of the whale ; \nwhich, so far as picturesqueness of effect is concerned, is \nabout tantamount to sketching the profile of a pyramid. \nEven Scoresby, the justly renowned right whaleman, \nafter giving us a stiff full-length of the Greenland whale, \nand three or four delicate miniatures of narwhales and \nporpoises, treats us to a series of classical engravings of \nboat-hooks, chopping-knives, and grapnels ; and with the \nmicroscopic diligence of a Leuwenhoeck submits to the \ninspection of a shivering world ninety-six facsimiles of \nmagnified Arctic snow crystals. I mean no disparagement \nto the excellent voyager (I honour him for a veteran), but \nin so important a matter it was certainly an oversight not \nto have procured for every crystal a sworn affidavit taken \nbefore a Greenland Justice of the Peace. \n\nIn addition to those fine engravings from Garnery, there \nare two other French engravings worthy of note, by some- \none who subscribes himself ' H. Durand.' One of them, \nthough not precisely adapted to our present purpose, \nnevertheless deserves mention on other accounts. It is a \nquiet noon-scene among the isles of the Pacific ; a French \nwhaler anchored, inshore, in a calm, and lazily taking \nwater on board ; the loosened sails of the ship, and the \nlong leaves of the palms in the background, both drooping \ntogether in the breezeless air. The effect is very fine, \nwhen considered with reference to its presenting the hardy \nfishermen under one of their few aspects of oriental \nrepose. The other engraving is quite a different affair : \nthe ship hove-to upon the open sea, and in the very heart \nof the leviathanic life, with a right whale alongside ; the \nvessel (in the act of cutting -in) hove over to the monster \nas if to a quay ; and a boat, hurriedly pushing off from \nthis scene of activity, is about giving chase to whales in \nthe distance. The harpoons and lances lie levelled for \nuse ; three oarsmen are just setting the mast in its hole ; \n\n\n\nLESS ERRONEOUS PICTURES 341 \n\nwhile from a sudden roll of the sea, the little craft stands \nhalf -erect out of the water, like a rearing horse. From \nthe ship, the smoke of the torments of the boiling whale \nis going up like the smoke over a village of smithies ; and \nto windward, a black cloud, rising up with earnest of \nsqualls and rains, seems to quicken the activity of the \nexcited seamen. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LVII \n\nOF WHALES IN PAINT ; IN TEETH ; IN WOOD ; IN SHEET- \nIRON ; IN STONE ; IN MOUNTAINS ; IN STARS \n\nON Tower Hill, as you go down to the London docks, you \nmay have seen a crippled beggar (or kedger, as the sailors \nsay) holding a painted board before him, representing \nthe tragic scene in which he lost his leg. There are three \nwhales and three boats ; and one of the boats (presumed \nto contain the missing leg in all its original integrity) is \nbeing crunched by the jaws of the foremost whale. Any \ntime these ten years, they tell me, has that man held up \nthat picture, and exhibited that stump to an incredulous \nworld. But the time of his justification has now come. \nHis three whales are as good whales as were ever published \nin Wapping, at any rate ; and his stump as unquestion- \nable a stump as any you will find in the Western clearings. \nBut, though forever mounted on that stump, never a \nstump-speech does the poor whaleman make ; but, with \ndowncast eyes, stands ruefully contemplating his own \namputation. \n\nThroughout the Pacific, and also in Nantucket, and \nNew Bedford, and Sag Harbour, you will come across \nlively sketches of whales and whaling scenes, graven by \nthe fishermen themselves on sperm whale-teeth, or ladies' \nbusks wrought out of the right whalebone, and other like \nskrimshander articles, as the whalemen call the numerous \nlittle ingenious contrivances they elaborately carve out \nof the rough material, in their hours of ocean leisure. \nSome of them have little boxes of dentistical-looking \n\n342 \n\n\n\nWHALES VARIOUSLY REPRESENTED 343 \n\nimplements, specially intended for the skrimshandering \nbusiness. But, in general, they toil with their jack- \nknives alone ; and, with that almost omnipotent tool of \nthe sailor, they will turn you out anything you please, \nin the way of a mariner's fancy. \n\nLong exile from Christendom and civilisation inevitably \nrestores a man to that condition in which God placed him, \ni.e. what is called savagery. Your true whale-hunter is as \nmuch a savage as an Iroquois. I myself am a savage, \nowning no allegiance but to the King of the Cannibals ; \nand ready at any moment to rebel against him. \n\nNow, one of the peculiar characteristics of the savage \nin his domestic hours, is his wonderful patience of industry. \nAn ancient Hawaiian war-club or spear-paddle, in its full \nmultiplicity and elaboration of carving, is as great a \ntrophy of human perseverance as a Latin lexicon. For, \nwith but a bit of broken sea-shell or a shark's tooth, that \nmiraculous intricacy of wooden net work has been achieved ; \nand it has cost steady years of steady application. \n\nAs with the Hawaiian savage, so with the white sailor- \nsavage. With the same marvellous patience, and with \nthe same single shark's tooth, of his one poor jack-knife, \nhe will carve you a bit of bone sculpture, not quite as \nworkmanlike, but as close packed in its maziness of \ndesign, as the Greek savage, Achilles's shield ; and full \nof barbaric spirit and suggestiveness, as the prints of that \nfine old Dutch savage, Albert Durer. \n\nWooden whales, or whales cut in profile out of the \nsmall dark slabs of the noble South Sea war-wood, are \nfrequently met with in the forecastles of American whalers. \nSome of them are done with much accuracy. \n\nAt some old gable-roofed country houses you will see \nbrass whales hung by the tail for knockers to the roadside \ndoor. When the porter is sleepy, the anvil-headed whale \nwould be best. But these knocking whales are seldom \n\n\n\n344 MOBY-DICK \n\nremarkable as faithful essays. On the spires of some old- \nfashioned churches you will see sheet-iron whales placed \nthere for weather-cocks ; but they are so elevated, and \nbesides that are to all intents and purposes so labelled \nwith ' Hands off ! ' you cannot examine them closely \nenough to decide upon their merit. \n\nIn bony, ribby regions of the earth, where at the base \nof high broken cliffs masses of rock lie strewn in fantastic \ngroupings upon the plain, you will often discover images \nas of the petrified forms of the leviathan partly merged \nin grass, which of a windy day breaks against them in a \nsurf of green surges. \n\nThen, again, in mountainous countries where the \ntraveller is continually girdled by amphitheatrical \nheights ; here and there from some lucky point of view \nyou will catch passing glimpses of the profiles of whales \ndefined along the undulating ridges. But you must be a \nthorough whaleman, to see these sights ; and not only \nthat, but if you wish to return to such a sight again, you \nmust be sure and take the exact intersecting latitude and \nlongitude of your first standpoint, else so chance-like are \nsuch observations of the hills, that your precise, previous \nstandpoint would require a laborious rediscovery ; like \nthe Soloma islands, which still remain incognita, though \nonce high-ruffed Mendanna trod them and old Figuera \nchronicled them. \n\nNor when expandingly lifted by your subject, can you \nfail to trace out great whales in the starry heavens, and \nboats in pursuit of them ; as when long filled with \nthoughts of war the Eastern nations saw armies locked \nin battle among the clouds. Thus at the North have I \nchased leviathan round and round the Pole with the \nrevolutions of the bright points that first defined him to \nme. And beneath the effulgent Antarctic skies I have \nboarded the Argo-Navis, and joined the chase against \n\n\n\nWHALES VARIOUSLY REPRESENTED 345 \n\nthe starry Cetus far beyond the utmost stretch of Hydras \nand the Flying Fish. \n\nWith a frigate's anchors for my bridle -bits and fasces \nof harpoons for spurs, would I could mount that whale \nand leap the topmost skies, to see whether the fabled \nheavens with all their countless tents really lie encamped \nbeyond my mortal sight ! \n\n\n\nCHAPTER LVII1 \n\nBRIT \n\nSTEERING north-eastward from the Crozetts, we fell in with \nvast meadows of brit, the minute, yellow substance upon \nwhich the right whale largely feeds. For leagues and \nleagues it undulated round us, so that we seemed to be \nsailing through boundless fields of ripe and golden wheat. \n\nOn the second day, numbers of right whales were seen, \nwho, secure from the attack of a sperm whaler like the \nPequod, with open jaws sluggishly swam through the brit, \nwhich, adhering to the fringing fibres of that wondrous \nVenetian blind in their mouths, was in that manner \nseparated from the water that escaped at the lip. \n\nAs morning mowers, who side by side slowly arid \nseethingly advance their scythes through the long wet \ngrass of marshy meads ; even so these monsters swam, \nmaking a strange, grassy, cutting sound ; and leaving \nbehind them endless swaths of blue upon the yellow \nsea. 1 \n\nBut it was only the sound they made as they parted \nthe brit which at all reminded one of mowers. Seen from \nthe mast-heads, especially when they paused and were \nstationary for a while, their vast black forms looked more \nlike lifeless masses of rock than anything else. And as \nin the great hunting countries of India, the stranger at a \n\n1 That part of the sea known among whalemen as the ' Brazil Banks ' \ndoes not bear that name as the Banks of Newfoundland do, because of \nthere being shallows and soundings there, but because of this remarkable \nmeadow-like appearance, caused by the vast drifts of brit continually \nfloating in those latitudes, where the right whale is often chased. \n346 \n\n\n\nBRIT 347 \n\ndistance will sometimes pass on the plains recumbent \nelephants without knowing them to be such, taking them \nfor bare, blackened elevations of the soil ; even so, often, \nwith him who for the first time beholds this species of \nthe leviathans of the sea. And even when recognised at \nlast, their immense magnitude renders it very hard really \nto believe that such bulky masses of overgrowth can \npossibly be instinct, in all parts, with the same sort of life \nthat lives in a dog or a horse. \n\nIndeed, in other respects, you can hardly regard any \ncreatures of the deep with the same feelings that you do \nthose of the shore. For though some old naturalists have \nmaintained that all creatures of the land are of their kind \nin the sea ; and though taking a broad general view of \nthe thing, this may very well be ; yet coming to specialities, \nwhere, for example, does the ocean furnish any fish that \nin disposition answers to the sagacious kindness of the \ndog ? The accursed shark alone can in any generic \nrespect be said to bear comparative analogy to him. \n\nBut though, to landsmen in general, the native in- \nhabitants of the seas have ever been regarded with \nemotions unspeakably unsocial and repelling ; though we \nknow the sea to be an everlasting terra incognita, so that \nColumbus sailed over numberless unknown worlds to \ndiscover his one superficial western one ; though, by vast \nodds, the most terrific of all mortal disasters have im- \nmemorially and indiscriminately befallen tens and \nhundreds of thousands of those who have gone upon the \nwaters ; though but a moment's consideration will teach, \nthat however baby man may brag of his science and skill, \nand however much, in a flattering future, that science and \nskill may augment ; yet forever and forever, to the crack \nof doom, the sea will insult and murder him, and pulverise \nthe stateliest, stiffest frigate he can make ; nevertheless, \nby the continual repetition of these very impressions, \n\n\n\n348 MOBY-DICK \n\nman has lost that sense of the full awfulness of the sea \nwhich aboriginally belongs to it. \n\nThe jirst boat we read of, floated on an ocean, that with \nPortuguese vengeance had whelmed a whole world with- \nout leaving so much as a widow. That same ocean rolls \nnow ; that same ocean destroyed the wrecked ships of \nlast year. Yea, foolish mortals, Noah's flood is not yet \nsubsided ; two -thirds of the fair world it yet covers. \n\nWherein differ the sea and the land, that a miracle \nupon one is not a miracle upon the other ? Preternatural \nterrors rested upon the Hebrews, when under the feet of \nKorah and his company the live ground opened and \nswallowed them up forever ; yet not a modern sun ever \nsets, but in precisely the same manner the live sea swallows \nup ships and crews. \n\nBut not only is the sea such a foe to man who is an alien \nto it, but it is also a fiend to its own offspring ; worse than \nthe Persian host who murdered his own guests ; sparing \nnot the creatures which itself hath spawned. Like a \nsavage tigress that tossing in the jungle overlays her \nown cubs, so the sea dashes even the mightiest whales \nagainst the rocks, and leaves them there side by side with \nthe split wrecks of ships. No mercy, no power but its \nown controls it. Panting and snorting like a mad battle- \nsteed that has lost its rider, the masterless ocean overruns \nthe globe. \n\nConsider the subtleness of the sea ; how its most \ndreaded creatures glide under water, unapparent for the \nmost part, and treacherously hidden beneath the loveliest \ntints of azure. Consider also the devilish brilliance and \nbeauty of many of its most remorseless tribes, as the \ndainty embellished shape of many species of sharks. \nConsider, once more, the universal cannibalism of the \nsea ; all whose creatures prey upon each other, carrying \non eternal war since the world began. \n\n\n\nBRIT 349 \n\nConsider all this ; and then turn to this green, gentle, \nand most docile earth ; consider them both, the sea \nand the land ; and do you not find a strange analogy to \nsomething in yourself ? For as this appalling ocean \nsurrounds the verdant land, so in the soul of man there \nlies one insular Tahiti, full of peace and joy, but encom- \npassed by all the horrors of the half -known life. God \nkeep thee ! Push not off from that isle, thou canst never \nreturn ! \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LIX \n\nSQUID \n\nSLOWLY wading through the meadows of brit, the Pequod \nstill held on her way north-eastward toward the island \nof Java ; a gentle air impelling her keel, so that in the \nsurrounding serenity her three tall tapering masts mildly \nwaved to that languid breeze, as three mild palms on a \nplain. And still, at wide intervals in the silvery night, \nthe lonely, alluring jet would be seen. \n\nBut one transparent blue morning, when a stillness \nalmost preternatural spread over the sea, however un- \nattended with any stagnant calm ; when the long bur- \nnished sun-glade on the waters seemed a golden finger \nlaid across them, enjoining some secrecy ; when the \nslippered waves whispered together as they softly ran on ; \nin this profound hush of the visible sphere a strange spectre \nwas seen by Daggoo from the mainmast-head. \n\nIn the distance, a great white mass lazily rose, and rising \nhigher and higher, and disentangling itself from the azure, \nat last gleamed before our prow like a snow-slide, new slid \nfrom the hills. Thus glistening for a moment, as slowly \nit subsided, and sank. Then once more arose, and silently \ngleamed. It seemed not a whale ; and yet is this Moby- \nDick ? thought Daggoo. Again the phantom went down, \nbut on reappearing once more, with a stiletto-like cry that \nstartled every man from his nod, the negro yelled out \n4 There ! there again ! there she breaches ! right ahead ! \nThe White Whale, the White Whale ! ' \n\nUpon this, the seamen rushed to the yard-arms, as in \nswarming-time the bees rush to the boughs. Bareheaded \nin the sultry sun, Ahab stood on the bowsprit, and with one \n\n350 \n\n\n\nSQUID 351 \n\nhand pushed far behind in readiness to wave his orders to \nthe helmsman, cast his eager glance in the direction indi- \ncated aloft by the outstretched motionless arm of Daggoo. \n\nWhether the flitting attendance of the one still and \nsolitary jet had gradually worked upon Ahab, so that he \nwas now prepared to connect the ideas of mildness and \nrepose with the first sight of the particular whale he \npursued ; however this was, or whether his eagerness \nbetrayed him ; whichever way it might have been, no \nsooner did he distinctly perceive the white mass, than with \na quick intensity he instantly gave orders for lowering. \n\nThe four boats were soon on the water ; Ahab's in \nadvance, and all swiftly pulling toward their prey. Soon \nit went down, and while, with oars suspended, we were \nawaiting its reappearance, lo ! in the same spot where it \nsank, once more it slowly rose. Almost forgetting for \nthe moment all thoughts of Moby-Dick, we now gazed \nat the most wondrous phenomenon which the secret seas \nhave hitherto revealed to mankind. A vast pulpy mass, \nfurlongs in length and breadth, of a glancing cream-colour, \nlay floating on the water, innumerable long arms radiating \nfrom its centre, and curling and twisting like a nest of \nanacondas, as if blindly to clutch at any hapless object \nwithin reach. No perceptible face or front did it have ; \nno conceivable token of either sensation or instinct ; but \nundulated there on the billows, an unearthly, formless, \nchance-like apparition of life. \n\nAs with a low sucking sound it slowly disappeared again, \nStarbuck still gazing at the agitated waters where it had \nsunk, with a wild voice exclaimed ' Almost rather had \nI seen Moby-Dick and fought him, than to have seen thee, \nthou white ghost ! ' \n\n' What was it, sir ? ' said Flask. \n\n' The great live squid, which, they say, few whale-ships \never beheld, and returned to their ports to tell of it.' \n\n\n\n352 MOBY-DICK \n\nBut Ahab said nothing ; turning his boat, he sailed \nback to the vessel ; the rest as silently following. \n\nWhatever superstitions the sperm whalemen in general \nhave connected with the sight of this object, certain it is, \nthat a glimpse of it being so very unusual, that circum- \nstance has gone far to invest it with portent ousness. So \nrarely is it beheld, that though one and all of them declare \nit to be the largest animated thing in the ocean, yet very \nfew of them have any but the most vague ideas concern- \ning its true nature and form ; notwithstanding, they \nbelieve it to furnish to the sperm whale his only food. \nFor though other species of whales find their food above \nwater, and may be seen by man in the act of feeding, the \nspermaceti whale obtains his whole food in unknown \nzones below the surface ; and .only by inference is it \nthat any one can tell of what, precisely, that food consists. \nAt times, when closely pursued, he will disgorge what are \nsupposed to be the detached arms of the squid ; some of \nthem thus exhibited exceeding twenty and thirty feet in \nlength. They fancy that the monster to which these arms \nbelonged ordinarily clings by them to the bed of the ocean ; \nand that the sperm whale, unlike other species, is supplied \nwith teeth in order to attack and tear it. \n\nThere seems some ground to imagine that the great \nKraken of Bishop Pontoppodan may ultimately resolve \nitself into Squid. The manner in which the Bishop de- \nscribes it, as alternately rising and sinking, with some \nother particulars he narrates, in all this the two corre- \nspond. But much abatement is necessary with respect \nto the incredible bulk he assigns it. \n\nBy some naturalists who have vaguely heard rumours \nof the mysterious creature, here spoken of, it is included \namong the class of cuttle-fish, to which, indeed, in certain \nexternal respects it would seem to belong, but only as the \nAnak of the tribe. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER LX \n\nTHE LINE \n\nWITH reference to the whaling scene shortly to be de- \nscribed, as well as for the better understanding of all \nsimilar scenes elsewhere presented, I have here to speak \nof the magical, sometimes horrible whale-line. \n\nThe line originally used in the fishery was of the best \nhemp, slightly vapoured with tar, not impregnated with \nit, as in the case of ordinary ropes ; for while tar, as \nordinarily used, makes the hemp more pliable to the rope- \nmaker, and also renders the rope itself more convenient \nto the sailor for common ship use ; yet, not only would \nthe ordinary quantity too much stiffen the whale-line for \nthe close coiling to which it must be subjected ; but as \nmost seamen are beginning to learn, tar in general by \nno means adds to the rope's durability or strength, how- \never much it may give it compactness and gloss. \n\nOf late years the Manilla rope has in the American \nfishery almost entirely superseded hemp as a material \nfor whale-lines ; for, though not so durable as hemp, it \nis stronger, and far more soft and elastic ; and I will add \n(since there is an aesthetics in all things), is much more \nhandsome and becoming to the boat, than hemp. Hemp \nis a dusky, dark fellow, a sort of Indian ; but Manilla \nis as a golden-haired Circassian to behold. \n\nThe whale-line is only two-thirds of an inch in thickness. \nAt first sight, you would not think it so strong as it really \nis. By experiment its one and fifty yarns will each sus- \npend a weight of one hundred and twenty pounds ; so \n\nVOL. i. z \n\n\n\n354 MOBY-DICK \n\nthat the whole rope will bear a strain nearly equal to three \ntons. In length, the common sperm whale-line measures \nsomething over two hundred fathoms. Toward the \nstern of the boat it is spirally coiled away in the tub, not \nlike the worm-pipe of a still though, but so as to form one \nround, cheese-shaped mass of densely bedded 'sheaves,' \nor layers of concentric spiralisations, without any hollow \nbut the 'heart/ or minute vertical tube formed at the \naxis of the cheese. As the least tangle or kink in the \ncoiling would, in running out, infallibly take somebody's \narm, leg, or entire body off, the utmost precaution is \nused in stowing the line in its tub. Some harpooneers \nwill consume almost an entire morning in this business, \ncarrying the line high aloft and then reeving it downward \nthrough a block toward the tub, so as in the act of coiling \nto free it from all possible wrinkles and twists. \n\nIn the English boats two tubs are used instead of one ; \nthe same line being continuously coiled in both tubs. \nThere is some advantage in this ; because these twin -tubs \nbeing so small they fit more readily into the boat, and do \nnot strain it so much ; whereas, the American tub, nearly \nthree feet in diameter and of proportionate depth, makes \na rather bulky freight for a craft whose planks are but \none half-inch in thickness ; for the bottom of the whale- \nboat is like critical ice, which will bear up a considerable \ndistributed weight, but not very much of a concentrated \none. When the painted canvas cover is clapped on the \nAmerican line-tub, the boat looks as if it were pulling off \nwith a prodigious great wedding-cake to present to the \nwhales. \n\nBoth ends of the line are exposed ; the lower end \nterminating in an eye -splice or loop coming up from the \nbottom against the side of the tub, and hanging over \nits edge completely disengaged from everything. This \narrangement of the lower end is necessary on two accounts. \n\n\n\nTHE LINE 355 \n\nFirst : In order to facilitate the fastening to it of an \nadditional line from a neighbouring boat, in case the \nstricken whale should sound so deep as to threaten to \ncarry off the entire line originally attached to the har- \npoon. In these instances, the whale of course is shifted \nlike a mug of ale, as it were, from the one boat to the \nother ; though the first boat always hovers at hand to \nassist its consort. Second : This arrangement is indis- \npensable for common safety's sake ; for were the lower \nend of the line in any way attached to the boat, and were \nthe whale then to run the line out to the end almost in a \nsingle, smoking minute as he sometimes does, he would \nnot stop there, for the doomed boat would infallibly \nbe dragged down after him into the profundity of the sea ; \nand in that case no town -crier would ever find her again. \n\nBefore lowering the boat for the chase, the upper end \nof the line is taken aft from the tub, and passing round the \nlogger-head there, is again carried forward the entire \nlength of the boat, resting crosswise upon the loom or \nhandle of every man's oar, so that it jogs against his wrist \nin rowing ; and also passing between the men, as they \nalternately sit at the opposite gunwales, to the leaded \nchocks or grooves in the extreme pointed prow of the boat, \nwhere a wooden pin or skewer the size of a common quill, \nprevents it from slipping out. From the chocks it hangs \nin a slight festoon over the bows, and is then passed inside \nthe boat again ; and some ten or twenty fathoms (called \nbox-line) being coiled upon the box in the bows, it con- \ntinues its way to the gunwale still a little further aft, and \nis then attached to the short -warp the rope which is \nimmediately connected with the harpoon ; but previous \nto that connection, the short -warp goes through sundry \nmystifications too tedious to detail. \n\nThus the whale-line folds the whole boat in its compli- \ncated coils, twisting and writhing around it in almost \n\n\n\n356 MOBY-DICK \n\nevery direction. All the oarsmen are involved in its \nperilous contortions ; so that to the timid eye of the \nlandsman, they seem as Indian jugglers, with the deadliest \nsnakes sportively festooning their limbs. Nor can any \nson of mortal woman, for the first time, seat himself amid \nthose hempen intricacies, and while straining his utmost \nat the oar, bethink him that at any unknown instant the \nharpoon may be darted, and all these horrible contortions \nbe put in play like ringed lightnings ; he cannot be thus \ncircumstanced without a shudder that makes the very \nmarrow in his bones to quiver in him like a shaken jelly. \nYet habit strange thing ! what cannot habit accom- \nplish ? Gayer sallies, more merry mirth, better jokes, \nand brighter repartees, you never heard over your \nmahogany, than you will hear over the half-inch white \ncedar of the whale-boat, when thus hung in hangman's \nnooses ; and, like the six burghers of Calais before King \nEdward, the six men composing the crew pull into the \njaws of death, with a halter around every neck, as you \nmay say. \n\nPerhaps a very little thought will now enable you to \naccount for those repeated whaling disasters some few \nof which are casually chronicled of this man or that man \nbeing taken out of the boat by the line, and lost. For, \nwhen the line is darting out, to be seated then in the boat \nis like being seated in the midst of the manifold whizzings \nof a steam-engine in full play, when every flying beam, \nand shaft, and wheel, is grazing you. It is worse ; for \nyou cannot sit motionless in the heart of these perils, \nbecause the boat is rocking like a cradle, and you are \npitched one way and the other, without the slightest \nwarning ; and only by a certain self-adjusting buoyancy \nand simultaneousness of volition and action can you \nescape being made a Mazeppa of, and run away with where \nthe all-seeing sun himself could never pierce you out. \n\n\n\nTHE LINE 357 \n\nAgain : as the profound calm which only apparently \nprecedes and prophesies of the storm is perhaps more \nawful than the storm itself ; for, indeed, the calm \nis but the wrapper and envelope of the storm ; and con- \ntains it in itself, as the seemingly harmless rifle holds the \nfatal powder, and the ball, and the explosion ; so the \ngraceful repose of the line, as it silently serpentines about \nthe oarsmen before being brought into actual play this \nis a thing which carries more of true terror than any other \naspect of this dangerous affair. But why say more ? \nAll men live enveloped in whale -lines. All are born with \nhalters round their necks ; but it is only when caught \nin the swift, sudden turn of death, that mortals realise \nthe silent, subtle, ever-present perils of life. And if you \nbe a philosopher, though seated in the whale-boat, you \nwould not at heart feel one whit more of terror, than \nthough seated before your evening fire with a poker, and \nnot a harpoon, by your side. \n\n\n\nEND OF VOL.
