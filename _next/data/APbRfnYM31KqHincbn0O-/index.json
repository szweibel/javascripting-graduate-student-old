It was used primarily for desktop applications, but as the web became a bigger deal, Java was positioned as the language of choice for web development.\n\n<CodeEditor language='JavaScript'>\n1 + 1\n</CodeEditor>\n\n## What am I doing here?\n\nYou the reader may have come to this page pre-convinced that you want to learn how to program. To the wholly unconvinced, I can only ask, \"Why are you taking this class?\" The majority, including myself at first, exist in a state between the two. I am not going to try to convince you of the 'value' of programming, as value is a personal question. Instead I will show you a few neat tools that  \n\n## Cool, inspiring libraries\n\nWhat's possible with JavaScript? JavaScript is a programming language that can be used to create dynamic web pages. It can be used to create interactive web applications, or to create data visualizations and animations. Here are some cool libraries that you can use with JavaScript.\n\n- [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/)\n- [D3.js](https://d3js.org/)\n- [p5.js](https://p5js.org/)\n- [leaflet.js](https://leafletjs.com/)\n\n# Getting Started with JavaScript\n\nLet's begin our journey with the JavaScript language. As is tradition, we're first going to explore some ways to print a \"Hello World!\" message as output to the screen. In doing so, you will be introduced to the basics of working with the JavaScript console. As will become clearer, you can think of the console as an interactive way to run basic JavaScript commands in your browser. \n\nTo become further acquainted with the console, we will end the lesson by exploring basic data types and variables in JavaScript, and how you can use these capabilities to calculate and display a variety of conditions.\n\n## Hello, World!\n\n### Alerts\n\nOne of the most basic ways to output a message is to use the `alert()` method. This method will display a message to the user visiting your web page, and then wait for the user to click on the \"OK\" button.\n\nTo create an alert, you can write the following line of code...\n\n```JavaScript\nalert(\"Hello, World!\");\n```\n\n...into the box below, where you can see an instance of the interactive console that we have provided for you. If you click your mouse after the `>` symbol (called the _prompt_), you can begin writing your code, and then hit the <kbd>Enter</kbd> key to run it.\n\n<JSTerminal />\n\nYou should now see a pop-up box that displays your message. __Note__: If you do _not_ see a pop-up message, you may need to disable your pop-up blocker.\n\nAs you can see, the alert dialog box takes the focus and forces the user to read the specified message on the current webpage. This being the case, it is wise to avoid overusing this method because it stops the user from accessing other parts of the webpage until the box is closed. It is best used as a kind of warning message. For instance, you may have seen developers use it to notify the user that they are heading to a new external website after clicking a link.\n\nYou'll notice that our message is enclosed in `()` (parentheses) as well as `\"\"` double quotations marks. You'll understand why as we continue: this indicates part of the _syntax_, or the rules that define the structure of the JavaScript language.\n\nYou will also notice that there is a `;`(semicolon) after the `alert` command. Not including the semicolon won't throw an error, but it is good practice to include after each command, or statement--after each single instruction given to the console. You'll see more examples of this (and learn when _not_ to include semicolons) as we progress. For now, make sure to __include the semicolon__ at the end of each line of code.\n\n### Using Your Browser's Console\n\nWhile we have provided a console for you embedded into this web page, you can also use the console to run commands directly from your browser's developer tools. Most modern browsers allow you access to a developer console where you can work with JavaScript and read or manipulate data on a page. \n\nTo open the developer console, you can use these methods:\n\n__Chrome:__\n- Command + Option + i (Mac)\n- Ctrl + Shift + i (Windows/Linux).\n- Open the Chrome settings menu in the top-right corner of your browser window and select `More Tools` > `Developer Tools`\n\n__Firefox:__\n- Command + Option + i (Mac)\n- Ctrl + Shift + i (Windows/Linux)\n\n__Safari:__\n- Develop menu in Safari’s Advanced preferences\n- Right-click on any page element and select Inspect Element\n- Command + Option + i\n\n__Opera:__\n- Command + Option + i (Mac)\n- Ctrl + Shift + i (Windows/Linux)\n\nUsing these shortcuts should open a console window that you can use to run commands. After the `>` prompt, create another new `alert` command and hit the <kbd>Enter</kbd> key to run it. You should again see a pop-up box that displays your message.\n\nWe should note here that the alert's system dialog box is not related to the design of the webpage currently being shown in the browser. Its appearance depends solely on your current operating system and browser (rather than on the HTML code of the current page). You will learn how to manipulate a webpage's content and appearance directly with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS in later lessons.  \n\n### The console.log() Function\n\nLet's use another technique to display \"Hello, World!\" This time, we will use the `console.log()` function, which writes a message to the console. In your browser's developer console, write the following line of code:\n\n```JavaScript\nconsole.log(\"Hello, World!\");\n```\n\nYou should see the message \"Hello, World!\" now printed out for you in the console itself.\n\nThe `console.log()` function is a useful tool for testing and debugging your code. As you continue learning JavaScript and begin building your own webpages, you will find it an effective way to display and understand the results of your programs.\n\n__Note__: If you also receive a message of `undefined` in the console, don't worry! You will understand why this is happening as you continue learning more about how functions work in JavaScript.\n\nFor now, let's continue working with the JavaScript console by exploring the way the language deals with data and discrete bits of information.\n\n## Data Types\n\n__Data types__ form the atomic elements of JavaScript programs and are used to store and manipulate data. The basic data types in JavaScript are: __number__, __string__, __boolean__, __array__, and __object__. For now, let's just discuss the first three of these types and how you can use them.\n\n### Numbers\n\nValues of the `number` type are, as you might have guessed, numbers. Try typing the following numbers into the console, hitting the <kbd>Enter</kbd> key after each one:\n\n```JavaScript\n> 9;\n> 3.8;\n> -1.2;\n```\n<JSTerminal />\n\nAs you can see, JavaScript recognizes a variety of different number categories. Unlike other programming languages you may (or may not) be familiar with, JavaScript does not define different types of numbers, like integer, double, etc. All numbers are recognized as the same type.\n\nWe can also perform various mathematical calculations on these numbers. For example, try running each of the following mathematical operations in the console:\n\n```JavaScript\n> 5 + 5\n> 5 - 5\n> 5 / 5\n> 5 * 5\n> 5 % 6\n```\n\n<JSTerminal />\n\nJavaScript effectively calculates the result of these operations for you. Whenever you can use a number, you can also create a mathematical expression using typical algebraic operators. The last example (in case you are unfamiliar) uses the <kbd>%</kbd> (remainder) symbol, which evaluates the remainder of a division.  \n\nIn the table below, you can see more of the various operators available to you as a JS programmer when working with data types. Many of the most useful operators deal in terms of _comparison_:  seeing if one value is equal to, greater than, or lesser than another value. Each of these comparisons will evaluate to either true or false. It is important to understand how these operators work, so try inputting some of the examples you might be unclear with into the JS console to check out the results for yourself.\n\n<table>\n    <caption><strong>Comparison Operators</strong></caption>\n    <tr>\n        <th>Operator</th>\n        <th>Meaning</th>\n        <th>Example</th>\n        <th>Evaluation</th>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <th rowspan = \"2\"> < </th>\n        <td> less than? </td>\n        <td> 5 < 5 </td>\n        <td>false</td>\n    </tr>\n   <tr>\n        <td> less than? </td>\n        <td> 5 < 6 </td>\n        <td>true</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <th rowspan = \"2\"> > </th>\n        <td> greater than? </td>\n        <td> 5 > 5 </td>\n        <td>false</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td> greater than? </td>\n        <td> 5 > 4 </td>\n        <td>true</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <th rowspan = \"2\"><=</th>\n        <td> less than or equal to? </td>\n        <td> 5 <= 5 </td>\n        <td>true</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td> less than or equal to? </td>\n        <td> 5 <= 4 </td>\n        <td>false</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <th rowspan = \"2\">>=</th>\n        <td> greater than or equal to? </td>\n        <td> 5 >= 5 </td>\n        <td>true</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td> greater than or equal to? </td>\n        <td> 5 >= 6 </td>\n        <td>false</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <th rowspan = \"3\">==</th>\n        <td> equal to? </td>\n        <td> 5 == 5 </td>\n        <td>true</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td> equal to? </td>\n        <td> 5 == 4 </td>\n        <td>false</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td> equal to? </td>\n        <td> 5 == \"5\" </td>\n        <td>true</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <th rowspan = \"3\">!=</th>\n        <td> not equal to? </td>\n        <td> 5 != 5 </td>\n        <td>false</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td> not equal to? </td>\n        <td> 5 != 4 </td>\n        <td>true</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td> not equal to? </td>\n        <td> 5 != \"5\" </td>\n        <td>false</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <th rowspan = \"2\">===</th>\n        <td> \"strict\" equal to (includes type)? </td>\n        <td> 5 === \"5\" </td>\n        <td>false</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td> \"strict equal\" to (includes type)? </td>\n        <td> 5 === 5 </td>\n        <td>true</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <th rowspan = \"2\">!==</th>\n        <td> \"strict\" not equal to (includes type)? </td>\n        <td> 5 !== \"5\" </td>\n        <td>true</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td> \"strict\" not equal to (includes type)? </td>\n        <td> 5 !== 5 </td>\n        <td>false</td>\n    </tr>\n</table>\n<br />\n\n<JSTerminal />\n\nWhile nearly all of these operators are shared amongst the majority of modern programming languages, the `===` (triple equals) is unique to JavaScript. The distinctions between `==` (double equals) and `===` (triple equals) are important. The double equals `==` operator is used to compare _only_ the value of two variables, while the \"strict\" triple equals `===` operator is used to compare the value _and_ type of two variables. The strict operator will only return true if the two variables are _exactly_ the same, both in value and in type (e.g., number or string). So, while both `5 === 5` and `\"5\" === \"5\"` will return true because they are the same value and type, `5 === \"5\"` will return false because the latter is testing a number against a string (discussed below). Also note the difference between the double equals `==` and triple equals `===`, which test for equality, and the `!=` and `!==` operators, which test for _inequality_.\n\nWe'll continue to work with comparison/equality operators throughout the course, so don't worry if they're still a bit unclear. Additionally, we have for now purposefully left out the `=` (single equals) operator, as it has a different function than evaluating equality. We'll cover the single equals operator later in this lesson.\n\n### Strings\n\nAs a data type, a __string__ is simply a series of alphanumeric characters, meaning it can combine both numbers and text into a phrase. Strings are mostly used for displaying or recognizing a series of text in your programs. You have actually already encountered a string--in the `console.log(\"Hello, World!\");` command you ran above, everything enclosed in the double-quotation marks (namely, `Hello, World!`) is considered a string. In the `\"5\" == \"5\"` example you just saw, each 5 is actually considered a _string_, rather than a number, because they are enclosed in quotation marks.\n\nJust like with numbers, you can simply type a string (for instance, `\"Hello, World!\"`) into the console and it will repeat your string back to you. It is important to note that were you to add a number to the string, e.g., `\"Hello, World in the Year 3030!\";`, the entire phrase would still be considered a string and _not_ a number. This is because you have enclosed it within double-quotation marks, which always indicates a `string` type.\n\nIt's worth noting that you can use both single- <kbd>'</kbd> and double-quotation <kbd>\"</kbd> marks to identify a string. It is important, however, to keep your use consistent. For instance, if you were to write `\"Hello, World!'`, beginning the phrase with double-quotes and ending with a single-quote, you will receive a `SyntaxError` (we'll cover how to deal with errors in a bit more detail later). It is best practice to primarily use double-quotes, as this allows you to use single-quotes _within_ a phrase without the console throwing errors. For example, `\"It is Jill's birthday.\"` is a perfectly valid expression, while `'It is Jill's birthday.'` is not.\n\n__Note__: If you need to use double-quotes inside of a string, there are two ways you can do this. You can, conversely, simply use single-quotation marks to surround a phrase, e.g., `'I wonder what \"truth\" means today?'`, or you can use a <kbd>\\</kbd> (backslash) to precede a double-quotation mark within enclosed double-quotation marks, e.g. `\"I wonder what \\\"truth\\\" means today?\"`. \n\nStrings can also utilize the `+` operator to __concatenate__, or join, separate string phrases together. For example, `\"Hello, \" + \"World!\"` will return `\"Hello, World!\"`. Try it out in the console below.\n\n<JSTerminal />\n\n### Boolean\n\nUnlike some real-world scenarios, determining what is true and false in JavaScript is refreshingly straightforward. __Booleans__ are data types that are either firmly `true` or `false`. In utilizing the comparison operators from the table earlier, you have already discovered how the console determines truth and falsity. For instance, typing `9 > 5` evaluates to `true`, whereas `5 > 9` evaluates to `false`. Similarly, `5 >= 5` as well as `5 <= 5` both resolve as `true`. If you simply type `true` or `false` into the console, the console recognizes it as a data type and will repeat it back to you.\n\nBooleans may seem simple, but very often in programming you will need a data type that can only have one of two values, akin to a \"yes\" or \"no\" or \"on\" or \"off\" determination. We will work more with booleans as we progress through the course.\n\nAs a final step for this lesson, let's make using data types a bit more interesting by introducing __variables__.\n\n## Variables\n\nNow that we have explored a number of data types and how to use them, let's explore how to create variables in JavaScript to utilize data types more effectively.\n\nYou can think of __variables__ as kinds of containers for data. They are named and can be assigned a value based on whatever data type is appropriate. To create a variable, you simply type the `var` keyword along with the name of the variable you want to create, followed by a single equal sign (`=`) and then the value of the variable. For example, `var myMessage = \"Hello, World!\";` will create a new variable called `myMessage` and assign it the value `\"Hello, World!\"`. Creating a variable is called __declaring__ or __defining__ it, and attributing a value to it is called __assigning__ it.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, this drastically sets apart the single equals `=` operator from the double equals `==` operator. The single equals operator is used to __assign__ a value to a variable, while the double equals operator (as well as the triple equals) is used to __test__ if two values or variables are equal to each other (without modifying either value).\n\nIn the example below, we have replicated our `Hello, World!` message, only this time using a variable. You can see that instead of simply logging the string `\"Hello, World!\"` to the console, we have assigned the string to a variable called `myMessage` and then logged the value of `myMessage` to the console.\n\n```JavaScript\n    var myMessage = \"Hello, World!\";\n    console.log(myMessage);\n```\n\nUnderstanding and working effectively with variables is probably the most important part of programming. They allow you to store data in memory, and then use that data to perform all kinds of operations upon it. Take a look at the example below:\n\n```JavaScript\nvar a = 1;\nvar b = 2;\nvar c = a + b;\n```\n\nYou'll notice that the variable `c` is assigned the value of `a + b`. In other words, here we are assigning the value of a variable to that of the addition of two other variables. What do you think the result would be if we were to `console.log(c);`? \n\nNow let's make something ever so slightly more interesting. Let's talk about the weather.\n\n```JavaScript\nvar weather = 'sunny';\nvar statement = 'The weather is ' + weather + ' today.';\n```\n\nEarlier, you saw how we can concatenate strings together to form a compound phrase. You can also use the `+` operator to combine strings and variables. In the above example, the variable `statement`, assigned `\"The weather is \" + weather + \" today.\"` will return the string `\"The weather is sunny today.\"`.\n\nAny of the data types you have already learned can be assigned to a variable. For example, you can assign a number to a variable, a string to a variable, a boolean to a variable, etc.\n\nAs your programs become more complex, it is generally good practice to declare all of your variables at the top of your program. This will make it easier to find and understand your code later. Take a look at the program below:\n\n```JavaScript\nvar book, author, isbn, description;\n\nbook = \"Hunger\";\nauthor = \"Knut Hamsun\";\nisbn = 0374525285;\n\ndescription = \"The book \" + book + \" by \" + author + \" is on ISBN \" + isbn;\nconsole.log(description);\n\nbook = \"The Master and Margarita\";\nauthor = \"Mikhail Bulgakov\";\nisbn = 0679760806;\n\ndescription = \"The book \" + book + \" by \" + author + \" is on ISBN \" + isbn;\nconsole.log(description);\n```\n\nAs you can see, we have declared all the variables we want to include for our categorization of the books at the top of the program (and all on the same line!). It is important to note that these variables persist only for the duration of your particular session with the console. If you close the console, they will be deleted from memory. You will also notice, however, that the values of the variables are __mutable__, meaning that they can be changed as the program progresses. If you run this program in the console, each `console.log()` command will display a new description. __Note__: Certain variable types are immutable, meaning that they cannot be changed. We'll explore additional details about immutable variables in later lessons.\n\n### Variable Naming Conventions\n\nThere are a few rules for variable naming conventions in JavaScript. \n- Variables must begin with a letter or an underscore. You can't begin a variable name with a number (although you can use numbers after). \n- Variables must not contain spaces or special characters. For example, `myVariable` is a valid variable name, but `my variable` is not.\n- Variable names are case sensitive. That is, a variable named `My_Books` is treated as an entirely different variable than one named `my_books`.\n- You can't use one of JavaScript's reserved words as a variable name. All programming languages have a supply of words that are used internally by the language. For a complete list, see here: [Reserved Words](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_reserved.asp).\n\nIn general, try to keep your variable names as short and descriptive of their purpose as possible.\n\n## Using typeof\n\nLet's end our discussion of variables with one more nifty tool: the `typeof` operator. The `typeof` operator is used to determine the data type of a variable. For example, if you have a variable named `myVariable`, you can use the `typeof` operator to determine what kind of data it is.\n\n```JavaScript\nvar myVariable = \"Hello, World!\";\nconsole.log(typeof myVariable);\n```\n\nIf you look at your developer console, you should see a `string` correctly identified as the data type of `myVariable`. You can use this operator to determine the data type of any variable you have created. This can become very useful when you are working with data types that are not explicitly defined or when you are converting data types from one type to another (which we'll begin learning in the next lesson).\n\n## Review Questions\n\nLet's review some of the main concepts we've covered in this lesson and get some practice in.\n\n1. `console.log()` is best used for (select one):\n\n<Quiz>\n- testing and debugging your code*\n- changing the appearance of a webpage\n- warning the user about something\n</Quiz>\n\n2. Select all of the following statements that will evaluate to `true`:\n\n<Quiz>\n- 5*\n- 5 = 5\n- 5 == 5*\n- 5 != 5\n- 5 === 5*\n- 5 !== \"5\"*\n</Quiz>\n\n3. Which of these variable names are legal (valid) in JavaScript? (select all that apply)\n\n<Quiz>\n- my_books* \n- myBooks*\n- my-books\n- myBooks1*\n- 1my_books\n- myBooks&I\n</Quiz>\n\n## Challenges\n\n1. In JavaScript, as in typical algebra, ambiguity in a mathematical expression is resolved by [rules of precedence (PEMDAS)](https://www.purplemath.com/modules/orderops.htm). For example, the expression `5 + 5` is evaluated as `10`, while the expression `5 + 5 * 5` is evaluated as `30`. Using the rules of precedence and the console, rework the expression `5 + 5 * 10 /2` so that it resolves to `50`. Next, utilizing the variables defined below, write an expression that resolves to `true` using the double equals `==` operator.\n\n```JavaScript\nvar a = 15;\nvar b = 10;\nvar c = 30;\nvar d = 5;\n```\n\n<JSTerminal />\n\n2. Using variables, write a simple program that 1) sends an `alert` to the user telling them to open the developer console in their browser and 2) logs a message to the console saying they have won a prize. __Note__: This is an imaginary practice scenario. In reality, you would want to avoid using `console.log()` to send messages to users when actually deploying your website. Any information you want the user of your webpage to see should be presented on the webpage itself.\n\n## Key Terms\n\nDo you recall the meaning of the following terms from this lesson?\n- boolean\n- string\n- variable\n- concatenation\n- declaration/assignment\n- mutability\n\n# Control Flow\n\nSo far in this course, we have been working with fairly simple programming structures. Our code thus far has been written as a single, linear, ordered list of instructions. However, there are other ways to structure your code that takes account of various conditions and reacts accordingly. \n\nWe are speaking here about __control flow__: the order in which the computer executes statements in a script.\n\nIn general, code is run in order from the first line in the file to the last line, unless the computer runs across the (extremely frequent) structures that change the control flow, such as conditionals and loops. We will explore several of these structures in this lesson and learn how to use them to create dynamic, branching programs. To put these skills to work, at the end of the lesson you will learn to build your own small text-based \"Choose Your Own Adventure\" game that allows players/readers to change the outcomes of a story based on their decisions. Let's get started! \n\n## Thinking in Code\n\nLet's talk about the process of thinking in code. What does someone think about before they write code? In your head, how might you imagine what the code in action would look like? \n\nIn general, we might present a few initial ideas about the process:\n1. The computer reads from top to bottom. It does things according to the instructions it reads, step by step. That's the sense in which we mean 'scripting'. My thought process is about the steps that are necessary to get from the beginning to a defined end. What kind of data do I have? How will it have to be transformed? What will be the result? That's the linear vision of scripting.\n2. Digging into the code is a lot more difficult and we really need to envision its structure. What might the structure of the code look like? What is the structure of the data itself? That's the hierarchical vision of scripting.\n3. A branching, rather than linear, vision of code is about the decisions that are made in the process of getting to the end. The branches in the program are equivalent to a \"decision tree.\" \n\n![Decision Tree](/images/decision-tree.drawio.png)\n\nLet's also think through what a \"Choose Your Own Adventure\" game would consist of. In simple terms, it would need:\n1. A predefined story (the story that the player is told)\n2. A set of choices that the player can make at certain points in the story \n3. An internal way to change the story based on the player's choices (code branching)\n4. A set of outcomes that the player can see based on their choices \n\nLet's keep these ideas in mind and use them as a rough roadmap for the rest of the lesson.\n\nFor now, let's not worry about the details of the story. Let's first start by exploring a simple way to allow the player to make choices and a way to store those choices.\n\n## Prompts\n\nOne of the simplest ways to gather user input is through the `prompt()` function. This function displays a message to the user and waits for them to enter a response in the response field. The `prompt()` function returns the user's response as a string. Let's take a look at it in detail.\n\n```JavaScript\n    var userName = prompt(\"What is your name?\");\n```\nHere is a simple example of the `prompt()` function in action. The user is asked to enter their name and waits for them to type it out and hit <kbd>Enter</kbd>. Once the user completes their name, their response will be stored in the variable `userName`. In other words, the function __returns__ the value you enter and stores it in the variable. Try running the code in the console below, answer the prompt, and then type `userName` in the console to see that the variable is now populated with the name you have entered.\n\n<JSTerminal />\n\nPretty nifty, right? `Prompt` code is like `alert` code, with a couple differences:\n1. In a prompt, you need a way to capture the user's response. So, you must begin the prompt with a variable declaration.\n2. In a prompt, you can specify a second message, which acts as a \"default\" value. If the user doesn't enter a response, the default message will be stored in the variable. For instance, we might make a prompt like: `var whatAmI = prompt(\"What am I?\", \"I am a human!\");`, in which `I am a human!` will prepopulate the response field and act as the default return value if the user doesn't enter anything themselves. \n\n### parseInt()\n\nIt's important to note that the user's response to a `prompt` is _always_ a string. If you want to store and handle the user's response as a number (so you can perform arithmetic on it), you will need to convert it to a number using the `parseInt()` function. The `parseInt()` function takes a string and returns the number it represents. For example, `parseInt(\"5\")` will return `5` (the number).\n\nLet's try this out now, this time asking the user their age:\n\n```JavaScript\n    var userAge = prompt(\"How old are you?\");\n    userAge = parseInt(userAge);\n    alert(\"You are \" + userAge + \" years old.\");\n    typeof userAge;\n```\n\n<JSTerminal />\n\nFor this example we simply update `userAge` with the new conversion value. As you can see by checking with `typeof`, the user's response is now registered as a number.\n\n__Note:__ This is not a foolproof data type conversion tactic and is easily broken. For instance, if you type the response \"one\" into the prompt instead of 1, the `parseInt` function will return a `NaN` (Not a Number) value. The `NaN` value is a special value that is returned when you try to perform arithmetic on a value that is not recognized as a number. For our purposes at the moment, however, this technique will suffice.\n\n## If/Else Statements\n\nSo far so good--we now have a way to capture user input. However, we don't yet have a way to react or respond to that input. For this we can use a different kind of structure called an __if/else statement__. These statements allow us to make decisions based on the value of a variable.\n\nThe basic structure of an `if/else` statement is:\n\n```JavaScript\n    if (condition) {\n        // code to run if condition is true\n    } else {\n        // code to run if condition is false\n    }\n```\n\nIf statements work like \"_If condition is met, then execute the task_\". In other words, the code in the `if` \"block\" will run if the `condition` (whatever it may be) is true and skip the `else` block, and the code in the `else` block will run if the `condition` is false and skip the initial `if` block. Note the beginning and ending curly braces `{}` surrounding each branch of the code: `if` and `else` always utilize curly braces, rather than semicolons. These braces always indicate a particular block of code and you will encounter them in many contexts.\n\nThe other new thing of note here is the text following the two forward slashes `//`: these are called __comments__. Comments are used to explain the code and are not executed by the computer. They are purely for human readers. As we continue to build more complex programs, we will often use comments to explain the code. Writing comments for yourself is an important way to make sure that you recall the purpose of the code you are writing if you return to it later. It also helps others reading your code to understand your intentions as well.\n\nLet's look at a more concrete example of an if/else statement, modifying our \"get the user's age\" program from above and seeing if they are legally eligible to buy alcohol in the U.S. Try running the code in the console below.\n\n```JavaScript\n    var userAge = prompt(\"How old are you?\");\n    userAge = parseInt(userAge);\n    if (userAge >= 21) {\n        alert(\"You are legally old enough to purchase alcohol in the U.S.\");\n    } else {\n        alert(\"You are not legally old enough to purchase alcohol in the U.S.\");\n    }\n```\n\n<JSTerminal />\n\nAfter gathering the user input and performing the conversion, we then use an `if/else` statement to determine if the user is old enough to purchase alcohol (that is, we check to see if they are 21 years or older). \n\n## Else If Statements\n\nUsing `else if`, you can utilize as many statements as you want in your code to check as many conditions as you need. Try running the following example in the console:\n\n```JavaScript    \n    var userAge = prompt(\"How old are you?\");\n    userAge = parseInt(userAge);\n\n    if (userAge >= 21) {\n        alert(\"You are legally old enough to purchase alcohol in the U.S.\");\n    } else if (userAge >= 18) {\n        alert(\"You are legally old enough to buy a gun (but not to purchase alcohol) in the U.S.\");\n    } else {\n        alert(\"You are not legally old enough to purchase alcohol in the U.S.\");\n    }\n```\n\n<JSTerminal />\n\nThe first `if` statement checks to see if the user is old enough to purchase alcohol. If they are, the `alert` message is displayed. If they are not, the second statement `else if` checks to see if they are able to buy a gun. If they are, the `alert` message is displayed. If they are not, the final `else` statement displays the `alert` message. The final `else` statement in a series is usually considered a default case or catchall to execute if none of the other `if/else` statements are true.\n\nAlong with testing as many conditions as you want, you can also run as many lines of code as you want in each block. You can even chain together a series of `if/else` statements. This is called __nesting__. For example:\n\n```JavaScript\nif (condition1){\n    // code to run if condition1 is true\n    if (condition2){\n        // code to run if condition2 is true\n        if (condition3){\n            // code to run if condition3 is true\n        } else {\n            // code to run if condition3 is false\n        }\n    } else {\n        // code to run if condition2 is false\n    }\n} else {\n    // code to run if condition1 is false\n}\n```\n\nAs you might be able to tell from just this example, too many nested `if/else` statements can be hard to read and hard to maintain, so try to keep them to a minimum whenever possible.\n\nTo help you understand how each block of this conditional cascade is structured, take a look at the diagram below:\n\n![if/else diagram](/images/if-else-diagram.png)\n\nThe arrows indicate the beginning (opening) and ending (closing) braces of a particular `if/else` statement. By matching the colors of each statement, you can see how the curly braces are continually nesting and designating their own blocks of code. While many modern code editors have their own built-in syntax highlighting (or coloring) as well as automatic indentation and bracing to make our code more visually understandable, it is still important to keep a close eye on your code and make sure you are following the correct structure and working in the correct block. \n\n## Switch Statements\n\nSwitch statements are another control flow structure used to handle multiple conditions. They are perhaps not as common, but they are useful to cover here briefly, as they can have a cleaner syntax than creating overly complex chains of `if/else` statements.\n\nThe basic structure of a switch statement is:\n\n```JavaScript\n    switch (variable) {\n        case value1:\n            // code to run if `variable` is `value1`\n            break;\n        case value2:\n            // code to run if `variable` is `value2`\n            break;\n        case value3:\n            // code to run if `variable` is `value3`\n            break;\n        default:\n            // code to run if `variable` is not `value1`, `value2`, or `value3`\n            break;\n    }\n```\n\nLike the `if/else` statement, the `switch` statement is broken into a series of `case` statements. Each `case` statement is a condition that the `switch` statement will check. The `switch` statement will then execute the code in the block that is associated with the first `case` statement that is evaluated as true. If none of the `case` statements are true, the `default` block will be executed.\n\nThe `break` statement is used to break out of the `switch` statement. The `break` statement is not required, but it is recommended to use it. If you omit the `break` statement, the `switch` statement will continue to execute the code in the next `case` statements even if they do not match the case.\n\nLet's take a look at a more concrete example of a `switch` statement. Let's say we were creating a computer game, and wanted to let the player pick a difficulty setting. Take a look at the following code and run it in the console:\n\n```JavaScript\n    var difficulty = prompt(\"What difficulty would you like to play? 1- Easy, 2- Medium, 3- Hard\");\n    switch (difficulty) {\n        case \"1\":\n            alert(\"You have selected the Easy difficulty.\");\n            break;\n        case \"2\":\n            alert(\"You have selected the Medium difficulty.\");\n            break;\n        case \"3\":\n            alert(\"You have selected the Hard difficulty.\");\n            break;\n        default:\n            alert(\"Invalid entry.\");\n            break;\n    }\n```\n<JSTerminal />\n\nHere we have three different difficulty levels (although you can have as many levels or `cases` as you want in a `switch` statement). The first `case` statement checks to see if the user entered `1`, the second `case` statement checks to see if the user entered `2`, and the final `case` statement checks to see if the user entered `3`. If the user entered `1`, `2`, or `3`, the `alert` message is displayed. If the user entered anything else, the `default` block is executed and an error message is shown. \n\nWhile this simple example could also easily be written using `if/else` statements, in your programming journey there may be times when writing a `switch` statement is more appropriate than writing many unwieldy `if/else` statements. Readability is just as important as functionality in programming.\n\n## Choose Your Own Adventure\n\nNow that you have a better understanding of some basic control flow structures in JavaScript, it's time to put them to work creating a simple Choose Your Own Adventure game using `prompt` for input and `alert()` for output. Since our game is meant to be a piece of interactive fiction, we'll want to use a variable to track player choices, and perhaps also let the player input their name to personalize the game and get things started.\n\n```JavaScript\n    var playerName, playerChoice;\n\n    var playerName = prompt(\"What is your name?\");\n    alert(\"Welcome, \" + playerName + \"!\");\n```\n\nNext, we can begin adding our story. I am going to show you an example, but feel free to get creative and write a story of your own. For my example, I am going to adapt the first two lines of Fredric Brown’s short story “Knock,” written in 1948. These two lines are a complete story in themselves and are widely considered one of the shortest and yet most evocative horror/sci fi stories to date. In Brown’s story, the first two lines are as follows: \n\n> “The last man on earth sat alone in a room.  There was a knock on the door.”\n\nI’m going to have some fun with this story and let the player decide what to do next. I will also modify the language a bit—because we are creating a Choose Your Own Adventure story, we want to use second person phrasing (you). So, my story will look rather like this:\n\n```JavaScript\n    alert(playerName + \", you are the last person on earth, sitting alone in a room. There is a knock on the door... What will you do?\");\n    playerChoice = prompt(\"Enter 1 to cautiously approach the door. Enter 2 to hide under the table.\");\n    if (playerChoice == \"1\"){\n        alert(\"Your hands are trembling as you approach the door. You pause a moment before it.\");\n    } else if (playerChoice == \"2\"){\n        alert(\"As you hide under the table you hear the doorknob rattling.\");\n    }\n    else {\n        alert(\"Invalid entry.\");\n    }\n```\n\nHere we have given the player two options by entering either `1` or `2` into the prompt. Now that we have their first options, we can add further options by nesting additional `if` statements:\n\n```JavaScript\n    if (playerChoice == \"1\"){\n        alert(\"Your hands are trembling as you approach the door. You pause a moment before it.\");\n        playerChoice = prompt(\"Enter 1 to bravely open the door. Enter 2 to look through the door's peephole.\");\n        if (playerChoice == \"1\"){\n            alert(\"You swing the door open with courageous gusto.\")\n        }\n        else if (playerChoice == \"2\"){\n            alert(\"You cautiously look through the peephole. You make out a vague shape looming before the door.\")\n        }\n        else {\n            alert(\"Invalid entry.\");\n        }\n    } else if (playerChoice == \"2\"){\n        alert(\"As you hide under the table you hear the doorknob rattling.\");\n        playerChoice = prompt(\"Enter 1 to stay hidden under the table. Enter 2 to get up and find a weapon to defend yourself with.\");\n        if (playerChoice == \"1\"){\n            alert(\"Whatever is at the door has now begun banging on it loudly.\");\n        }\n        else if (playerChoice == \"2\"){\n            alert(\"You quickly but quietly get up and look around. You see a broom in the corner of the room and wield it mightily.\");\n        }\n        else {\n            alert(\"Invalid entry.\");\n        }\n    }\n    else {\n        alert(\"Invalid entry.\");\n    }\n```\n\nOkay, now we have some additional options for the player to choose from, along with more error messages if they choose incorrectly. Putting it all together then, here is the story so far:\n\n```JavaScript\n    var playerName, playerChoice;\n\n    var playerName = prompt(\"What is your name?\");\n    alert(\"Welcome, \" + playerName + \"!\");\n\n    alert(playerName + \", you are the last person on earth, sitting alone in a room. There is a knock on the door... What will you do?\");\n    playerChoice = prompt(\"Enter 1 to cautiously approach the door. Enter 2 to hide under the table.\");\n    if (playerChoice == \"1\"){\n        alert(\"Your hands are trembling as you approach the door. You pause a moment before it.\");\n        playerChoice = prompt(\"Enter 1 to bravely open the door. Enter 2 to look through the door's peephole.\");\n        if (playerChoice == \"1\"){\n            alert(\"You swing the door open with courageous gusto.\")\n        }\n        else if (playerChoice == \"2\"){\n            alert(\"You cautiously look through the peephole. You make out a vague shape looming before the door.\")\n        }\n        else {\n            alert(\"Invalid entry.\");\n        }\n    } else if (playerChoice == \"2\"){\n        alert(\"As you hide under the table you hear the doorknob rattling.\");\n        playerChoice = prompt(\"Enter 1 to stay hidden under the table. Enter 2 to get up and find a weapon to defend yourself with.\");\n        if (playerChoice == \"1\"){\n            alert(\"Whatever is at the door has now begun banging on it loudly.\");\n        }\n        else if (playerChoice == \"2\"){\n            alert(\"You quickly but quietly get up and look around. You see a broom in the corner of the room and wield it mightily.\");\n        }\n        else {\n            alert(\"Invalid entry.\");\n        }\n    }\n    else {\n        alert(\"Invalid entry.\");\n    }\n```\n\nTry writing a short story of your own in the code editor below. (You can also copy/paste the code from mine if you want to see it in action.)\n\n<CodeEditor language='JavaScript'>\n</CodeEditor>\n\nWhile this approach to creating a Choose Your Own Adventure program works, it is very clunky and quite hard to read. As we said before, simply using a bunch of nested `if/else` statements makes a program incredibly difficult to build and maintain. Also, if the player incorrectly inputs a number, this program simply exits rather than prompting them to try again. Thankfully, JavaScript has many tools to help us address these issues. As we continue to learn more about the language, we will learn to use more control flow structures and data types to make our programs more readable and maintainable. Specifically, in the next lesson we will begin learning about loops and how to use them to repeat blocks of code, iterate over a series of values, and make our programs more efficient overall.\n\n## Review Questions\n\nLet's review the concepts we have learned in this lesson.\n\n1. The `prompt()` function always returns a `string`.\n\n<Quiz>\n- True*\n- False\n</Quiz>\n\n2. The code snippet below will throw errors or otherwise not work as intended. Why? Take a minute to look over it yourself, then select all that apply in the quiz below.\n\n```JavaScript\nprompt(\"What is your name?\");\nif (name = \"Sal Ami\")\n    alert(\"Hello name!\");\nelse\n    alert(\"It's too bad your name isn't\" + name + \".\");\n```\n\n<Quiz>\n- `prompt()` needs to be assigned to a variable.*\n- a double-equals (rather than a single equals) operator is needed in the `if` statement.*\n- the first `alert` will not correctly display the name.*\n- the `if/else` statement needs curly braces.*\n</Quiz>\n\n3.

Utilizing `switch` statements, write a short Choose Your Own Adventure story that allows the player 3 choices to choose from at a time.\n\n<CodeEditor language='JavaScript'>\n</CodeEditor>\n\n## Key Terms\n\nDo you recall the meaning of the following terms from this lesson?\n- control flow\n- return\n- comments\n- nesting\n\n# Loops and Arrays\n\nIn this lesson we will begin exploring how to use __loops__ to repeat blocks of code and iterate over a series of values. We will also learn to work with a very versatile new data type called `arrays`. To put these skills to work, at the end of the lesson we will create a simple library app that allows users to search for a book and see if it is located in the library's collection. \n\n## Arrays\n\nLet's begin by learning about the `array` data type. So far, you have encountered variables that only contain a single value. An array, in contrast, is a _series_ or a _collection_ of values stored in a single variable. The following is an example of four different arrays:\n\n```JavaScript\nvar myArray1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\nvar myArray2 = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e'];\nvar myArray3 = [true, false, true, false];\nvar myArray4 = [1, 2, 'dog', true, [1, 2, 3]];\n```\n\nCreating an array is just like other variable declarations you have seen, but the items it contains are always denoted by square brackets `[]`. An array can house any of the data types we have encountered so far. The first array, for example, contains a series of numbers, the second array contains a series of letters, and the third array contains a series of booleans. Arrays are very versatile and can also contain a mix of different data types, like in the fourth example. As you can see, this array even contains another array `[1, 2, 3]`!\n\nArrays are useful when you want to have a series of values that are easily accessible. Creating an individual variable for each of the values in the example above, for instance, would make your code very confusing and hard to work with.\n\nLet's look at how we can access the values in an array.\n\n## Accessing Values in an Array\n\nTo work with particular values in an array, we access its __index__. Values in an array are numbered starting from 0. The first value in an array is at index 0, the second value at index 1, and so on. Take a look at the example below:\n\n```JavaScript\nvar myArray = [1, 2, 'dog', true, [1, 2, 3]];\nalert(myArray[0]); // returns 1\n```\n\nWe access the index of an array by using the square brackets `[]` and the corresponding index number. The code snippet above will `alert` the value at index 0 of the array `myArray`. Remember, 0 is the _first_ value in an array, 1 is the _second_ value, and so on.\n\nTry using `alert` to display the value for each of the items from the example in the code editor below:\n\n<CodeEditor language='JavaScript'>\n    </CodeEditor>\n\nAs you can see, when you access the value at index 4 (`myArray[4]`), you get the value `1, 2, 3`. Again, this is because the value at index 4 is an array itself.\n\n## Changing Values in an Array\n\nTo change the value at a particular index in an array, we use the same syntax. We use the square brackets `[]` and the index number to access the value, and then assign that index a new value.\n\n```JavaScript\nvar myArray = [1, 2, 'dog', true, [1, 2, 3]];\nmyArray[0] = 'cat';\nalert(myArray[0]); // returns 'cat'\n```\n\nIn this example, the value at index 0 will be changed to `'cat'`.\n\n## Adding Values to an Array\n\nTo add a new value to the end of an array, we use the `push()` method. This method takes a single value and adds it to the end of the array.\n\n```JavaScript\nvar myArray = [1, 2, 'dog', true, [1, 2, 3]];\nmyArray.push('cat');\nalert(myArray[5]); // returns 'cat'\n```\n\nThis code adds the value `'cat'` to the end of the array `myArray`.\n\n## Removing Values from an Array\n\nTo remove a value from an array, we can use the `pop()` method. This method removes the last value in the array and returns it.\n\n```JavaScript\nvar myArray = [1, 2, 'dog', true, [1, 2, 3]];\nmyArray.pop();\nalert(myArray[4]);\n```\n\nTry running this code in the code editor below.\n\n<CodeEditor language='JavaScript'>\n    </CodeEditor>\n\nOh no, we are now getting a message of `undefined`! But this is exactly what we intended to happen, because the `pop()` method removed the last value in the array, so when we try to access it JavaScript finds nothing there.\n\n## Splicing an Array\n\nIf we want to remove a range of values from an array or start at a particular index, we can use the `splice()` method. This method takes two parameters: the first parameter is the index number of the first value we want to start from and remove, and the second parameter is the number of values to remove in total.\n\n```JavaScript\nvar myArray = [1, 2, 'dog', true, [1, 2, 3]];\nmyArray.splice(0, 2);\nalert(myArray[0]); // returns 'dog'\n```\n\nIn this example, the first two values in the array `myArray` are removed (we start at index 0 and remove two values total). After the operation, the value at index 0 is now `'dog'`.\n\n## Determining the Length of an Array\n\nIt may not always be clear to you how many values are actually stored in a particular array at any given time, especially if it becomes very large or you are adding and removing a lot of elements. To determine the number of values in an array, we use the `length` property. The `length` property returns the number of values in an array. For example:\n\n```JavaScript\nvar myArray = [1, 2, 'dog', true, [1, 2, 3]];\nalert(myArray.length); // returns 5\n```\n\nWe utilize `length` by prefacing it with a `.` (dot). This is called _dot notation_, and indicates we are working with a __method__. We'll cover what exactly methods are in later lessons, but for now keep in mind you utilize `length` with a dot and the array you want to work with.\n\nAs you can see, `length` counts through the values in the array, so it will return 5. It is important to note here that `length` starts with 1, not 0, so although the last value in the array is at index 4, `length` will still return 5. Confusing, right? It is simply a quirk of the language to get used to, so keep it in mind when working with arrays.\n\nAs an example, if you want to access the last value in the array, you can use the `[length - 1]` syntax. This will always return the last value in the array:\n\n```JavaScript\nvar myArray = [1, 2, 'dog', true, [1, 2, 3]];\nalert(myArray[myArray.length - 1]); // returns [1, 2, 3]\n```\n\nThis is a useful way to access the last value in an array even when you don't know how many elements the array holds.\n\n## The sort() Method\n\nLet's take a look at one last method that we can use on arrays. The `sort()` method sorts an array in alphabetical order, and is particularly useful if you have an array of letters or strings:\n\n```JavaScript\nvar myArray = ['c', 'b', 'a', 'e', 'd'];\nmyArray.sort();\nalert(myArray); // returns ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']\n```\n\nYou can, however, also use the `sort()` method to sort an array in numerical order. For example:\n\n```JavaScript\nvar myArray = [2, 4, 3, 1, 5];\nmyArray.sort();\nalert(myArray); // returns [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n```\n\nThere are [many other methods](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_array_methods.asp) you can perform on arrays, and we have only scratched the surface here. But keep in mind that arrays are a powerful tool for storing and manipulating data. Let's now take a look at how we can loop through arrays to make our code more efficient.\n\n## Looping Through an Array\n\nWe have so far seen how we can access values in an array, and manipulate them in ways that are useful. But what if we want to do something with every value in an array? For instance, if we wanted to print out every value in an array, it would be very tedious to write out the same code over and over like so:\n\n```JavaScript\nmyArray[0];\nmyArray[1];\nmyArray[2];\nmyArray[3];\n...\n```\n\nThankfully, there is a way to do this in a more efficient way. Let's explore a new kind of technique called __looping__. Looping is a way to iterate through a structure and perform an action on each element.\n\n## The For Loop\n\nWhen you want to loop through an array, the most common way is with a `for` loop. This loop will __iterate__ through the array and execute a block of code for each value in the array.\n\nThe general structure of a `for` loop is as follows:\n\n```JavaScript\nfor (var i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {\n    // do something\n}\n```\n\nThis may look a little complicated, so let's explore it a bit. The `for` loop is comprised of three parts: the first part is the initialization of the loop, which is the variable `i` in this case (`i` is often used by convention, but the variable name can be anything you want). The second part is the condition that the loop will continue to execute until, and the third part is the incrementor. Each is separated by a semi-colon `;`.\n\nTo break it down a little more:\n- `var i = 0`: This is the starting point of the loop. It will serve as the index number of the first element in the array.\n- `i < array.length`: This is the condition of the loop. It is a boolean expression that determines whether the loop should continue. In other words, it says: \"while `i` is less than the `length` of the array, do the following:\".\n- `i++`: This is the incrementor. `++` is a new operator that means that the value of `i` will increase or ___increment__ by 1 each time the loop executes. We use it to increment the index number of the loop so that it will continually move to the next element in the array. \n\n Let's see how this works in action using our `myArray` array from earlier:\n\n```JavaScript\nvar myArray = [1, 2, 'dog', true, [1, 2, 3]];\nfor (var i = 0; i < myArray.length; i++) {\n    alert(myArray[i]);\n}\n```\n\nTry running this code in the code editor below.\n\n<CodeEditor language='JavaScript'>\n    </CodeEditor>\n\nAs you can see, the loop iterated through the array and alerted each value in the array. You'll notice that the loop executed the alert 5 times instead of displaying all the values at once. This is because the loop is executing the alert once for each value in the array. In other words, the code inside the `for` loop block executes once for each value in the array based on the current value of `i`. So, if there are 5 values in the array, the loop will execute 5 times.\n\n## The While Loop\n\nThe `while` loop is similar to the `for` loop, but it will infinitely execute the code inside a loop until a certain specified condition is met. This is useful if you want a certain code block to run until a particular outcome is resolved. Let's look at an example: \n\n```JavaScript\nvar i = 0;\nwhile (i < 5) {\n    alert(i);\n    i++;\n}\n```\n\nAs you can see, the loop executed the alert 5 times, incrementing the value of `i` each time. In other words, this code is saying: \"while `i` is less than 5, do the following:\".\n\n## Putting It All Together - The Library App\n\nLet's use the skills we've learned in this lesson to create a simple app that will allow us to sort, display, and search for book titles from our library.\n\nTo begin, let's imagine a number of fiction titles that are available in our library and add them to an array. We'll sort this array to put it in alphabetical order. We will also create an empty array `libRequests` that will store all the requests from the user, and an empty string `requestedTitle` that will store the title of the book that the user requested in the prompt.\n\n```JavaScript\nvar bookTitles = [\n    'Too Loud a Solitude',\n    'Things Fall Apart',\n    'The Master and Margarita',\n    'The Three Body Problem',\n    'The Woman Destroyed',\n    'Beloved',\n    'The Tenant of Wildfell Hall',\n    \"Lady Chatterley's Lover\",\n];\n\nbookTitles.sort()\nvar libRequests = []\nvar requestedTitle = \"\";\n```\n\nNext, let's give the user a short welcome message. We will also let them know they can make a request by typing `request` at the prompt, display all book titles by typing `display`, or quit the program by typing `quit`:\n\n```JavaScript\nalert(\"Welcome to the library!\\n\\nPlease search for a book title when prompted.\\n\\nType `request` at the prompt to make a request for a book.\\n\\nYou can also type `display` at the prompt to display all available book titles.\\n\\nType `quit` at the prompt to quit the program.\");\n```\n\nOur welcome message gives the user a few options for what they can do. To keep the text display neat, we use `\\n` characters to create two new lines after each statement.\n\nAt this point, we can envision a few things about how our program should operate:\n- We want to allow the user to search for books until they decide to quit. So, a `while` loop will be needed.\n- We want to check if the user types request or display at the prompt. If they do, we want to perform the appropriate action. So, we will need several `if/else` statements. \n- We want to iterate through the array of book titles and display each one. So, we can use a `for` loop to accomplish this.\n\nOkay, so far so good. However, we are missing one crucial piece. We want the program to check if a book title the user enters is in the library. That is, we want to see if the string the user enters matches an item in the array `bookTitles`. How can we do this? Let's introduce a new method: `indexOf`.\n\n### indexOf\n\n`indexOf` is a method that returns the index of the first occurrence of a value in an array. If the value is not found, it will return `-1`. Here's an example:\n\n```JavaScript\nvar myArray = ['dog', 'cat', 'bird', 'fish'];\nmyArray.indexOf('dog'); // returns 0\nmyArray.indexOf('cat'); // returns 1\nmyArray.indexOf('bird'); // returns 2\nmyArray.indexOf('fish'); // returns 3\nmyArray.indexOf('cow'); // returns -1\n```\n\nUsing this method, we can check if a book title the user enters is in the library (if the string the user enters matches an item in the array `bookTitles`). If it doesn't (if the method returns `-1`), we can alert the user that the book they requested is not in the library.\n\nWith this method we should now have everything we need. Let's put the whole program together:\n\n```JavaScript\nvar bookTitles = [\n    'Too Loud a Solitude',\n    'Things Fall Apart',\n    'The Master and Margarita',\n    'The Three Body Problem',\n    'The Woman Destroyed',\n    'Beloved',\n    'The Tenant of Wildfell Hall',\n    \"Lady Chatterley's Lover\",\n];\n\nbookTitles.sort();\nvar libRequests = [];\nvar requestedTitle = \"\";\n\nalert(\"Welcome to the library!\\n\\nPlease search for a book title when prompted.\\n\\nType `request` at the prompt to make a request for a book.\\n\\nYou can also type `display` at the prompt to display all available book titles.\\n\\nType `quit` at the prompt to quit the program.\");\n\nvar response = \"\";\nwhile (response != 'quit') {\n    response = prompt(\"Search for a book title or make a request by typing 'request': \");\n    if (response == 'request') {\n        requestedTitle = prompt(\"What book would you like to request? \");\n        libRequests.push(requestedTitle); // add the requested title to the library requests array\n        alert(\"You have requested the following titles:\" + libRequests + \".\"); // alert the user their requests\n    }\n    else if (response == 'display') {\n        for (var i = 0; i < bookTitles.length; i++) {\n            alert(bookTitles[i]); // display all available book titles\n            }\n    }\n    else {\n        var bookIndex = bookTitles.indexOf(response); // check if the book the user entered is in the library\n        if (response != 'quit'){\n            if (bookIndex == -1) {\n                alert(\"Sorry, we don't have that book. You can always request it.\");\n            }\n            else {\n                alert(\"Yes, \" + response + \" is available to check out.\");\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nTry running and exploring the program:\n\n<CodeEditor language='JavaScript'>\n    </CodeEditor>\n\nLet's break down the logic of the program a bit. First, we have a `var response = \"\";` line. This is an empty string variable declaration meant to store the user's response to the prompt. We will use this variable to determine whether or not the user wants to make a request, display, or quit, or else search for the book in our library. Next, we have a `while` loop that will continue to execute until the user types `quit`. Within the `while` loop, we first check if the user's response is `request` or `display`. If it is, we can perform the appropriate action using `if/else` statements. To display all book titles, we use a `for` loop to alert each book. If the response is not a defined user action, we can check if the string is in the library. We use the `indexOf` method to check if the `response` string is in the library. If it is, we can alert the user that the book is available to check out. If it isn't (if the method returns `-1`), we can alert the user that the book is not in the library.\n\nCongratulations! You have now successfully created a basic library search program. There are, of course, a number of limitations to this program. For instance: \n- The search parameters are not very robust. The user must type out the full title of the book, with the exact spelling and punctuation of the title. As you might imagine, this is not a very good user experience.\n- The `for` loop sends an alert for each book in the library. This is not ideal, especially if we had a large amount of books. We would want to display the books in a more organized manner.\n\nThese are basic considerations we would want to take into account if we were actually designing a library search program. However, if you can understand how this program works, you are well on your way to creating complex and robust JavaScript programs. To get some practice in, try out the challenges below.\n\n## Review Questions\n\nLet's review the concepts we have learned in this lesson.\n\n1. What will be the result of the `alert` in the program below?\n\n```JavaScript\nvar myArray = [1, 2, 'dog', true, [1, 2, 3]];\nmyArray.pop();\nalert(myArray[4]);\n```\n\n<Quiz>\n- 1, 2, 3\n- true\n- undefined*\n</Quiz>\n\n2. What will be the result of the `alert` in the following code?\n\n```JavaScript\nvar myArray = [1, 2, 'dog', true, [1, 2, 3]];\nalert(myArray.length);\n```\n\n<Quiz>\n- 4\n- 5*\n- 6\n</Quiz>\n\n3. What will be the result of the `alert` in the following code?\n\n```JavaScript\nvar myArray = [1, 2, 'dog', true, [1, 2, 3]];\nmyArray.splice(0, 2);\nalert(myArray[0]);\n```\n\n<Quiz>\n- 1\n- 2\n- dog*\n- true\n- [1, 2, 3]\n</Quiz>\n\n## Challenges\n\n1. Write a `for` loop that prints all even numbers from 0 to 100 to the console.\n\n2. The library program currently requires the user to enter exact punctuation and capitalization of a book title. This is not a very robust search. Try improving the program using the [toLowerCase method](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_tolowercase.asp) to make the search parameters case insensitive. _Hint: You will want to perform the toLowerCase method both on the user's response and the book titles in the library._\n\n## Key Terms\n\nDo you recall the following terms from this lesson?\n- `array`\n- `index`\n- `length`\n- `push`\n- `pop`\n- `splice`\n- `sort`\n- `indexOf`\n\n# Functions\n\nIn the last lesson, we learned how to loop through a series of statements to repeat blocks of code. As you saw, this can be very useful if we want to automate a series of tasks that would otherwise take forever to write out manually. __Functions__ are another technique that can be used to repeat and reuse blocks of code and help us automate tasks. In this lesson, we will learn how to create our own functions and how to use them. To this end, at the end of the lesson we will create a simple grading program that will allow you to add, calculate, and display student grades.\n\n## What are Functions?\n\nFunctions are blocks of code that are designed to perform a specific task and can be reused. When developing applications, you will likely need to perform the same action in many different places. For example, you may need to perform a specific calculation on a number of different values and in different places in your code. Or, you might want to show an error message whenever an error occurs. Instead of rewriting the same code over and over again to perform these actions, you can wrap the code in a function and then call the function whenever you need to perform the action.\n\nThe basic syntax for creating a function is as follows:\n\n```JavaScript\nfunction functionName(parameter1, parameter2, ...) {\n    // code to be executed\n    return value;\n}\n```\n\nTo create a function, you must first define the function name. Naming conventions for functions are [lower CamelCase](https://wiki.c2.com/?LowerCamelCase), in which the first word is lowercase and the following words begin with a capital letter. Next you define the function's __parameters__ or __arguments__ within closed parentheses `()`. The parameters are the values that will be __passed__ into the function when it is called. Passing in parameters allows us to reuse the same function for different tasks, because we can pass in different values to the function each time we want to reuse it. The parameters are separated by commas. You can define as many parameters as you want.\n\nLike loops, you can see that functions use curly braces to define their contents. The contents of the function are the code that will be executed whenever the function is called.\n\nFor a procedure to be designated a function, it will also __return__ a value. In other words, a function takes some input, transforms that input somehow, and returns an output. \n\nTo make this all clearer, let's look at a basic example of a function. We will create a function called `add` that takes two numbers as parameters and returns the sum of the two numbers.\n\n```JavaScript\nfunction add(num1, num2) {\n    return num1 + num2;\n}\n```\nFirst we define the function `add()` with two parameters to pass in, `num1` and `num2`. To add the two numbers we can simply return `num1 + num2`. Note that we could also have defined a variable `sum` and then returned `sum`, like so:\n\n```JavaScript\nfunction add(num1, num2) {\n    var sum = num1 + num2;\n    return sum;\n}\n```\n\nThis is functionally the same result. The only difference is that we have created a new variable within the function to store the sum.\n\n## Calling a Function\n\nIf you were to run the code above, you would see that nothing happens. This is because we have not __called__ the function yet. To call a function, we simply use the function name followed by parentheses. The parentheses contain the values that will be passed into the function. Let's try calling the `add()` function with two number values:\n\n```JavaScript\nfunction add(num1, num2) {\n    return num1 + num2;\n}\n\nadd(1, 2);\n```\n\nTry running this code in the editor below.\n\n<CodeEditor language='JavaScript'>\n    </CodeEditor>\n\nAs you can see, the result of the `add()` function above returns 3 to the console. This is because `add()` takes two numbers as parameters and returns the sum of the two numbers. In this case, `num1` is 1 and `num2` is 2. If you change the values of `num1` and `num2` to different numbers, the result will also change. Again, this allows us to reuse the `add()` function to perform the same calculation on different values.\n\nWe could also capture the result of the function in a variable and then work with that variable. For example:\n\n```JavaScript\nfunction add(num1, num2) {\n    var sum = num1 + num2;\n    return sum;\n}\n\nvar result = add(1, 2);\nalert(result);\n```\n\nHere we are calling the `add` function and storing the result of the function (the return value) in the variable `result`. We can then use the variable to perform whatever action we want.\n\n__Note:__ Make sure you are passing in the correct number of parameters when calling a function (at least for functions you have created yourself. Built-in functions inherent to JavaScript can behave a little differently, but don't worry about that right now). If you call the function with too few parameters or too many parameters, your function will likely either behave in unexpected ways or throw an error.\n\nIt is worth pointing out that you can also call a function with no parameters and also without an explicit `return` statement. For example, we can create a function called `alertHello` that will simply alert \"Hello!\" to the user.\n\n```JavaScript\nfunction alertHello() {\n    alert('Hello!');\n}\n\nalertHello();\n```\n\nRunning this code will alert \"Hello!\" to the user.\n\nNote that if your code does not have a return statement or if the content does not return a value, JavaScript functions will automatically return `undefined`.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```JavaScript\nfunction doNothing() {\n    // do nothing\n}\n\ndoNothing();\n```\n\nIf you type this code into the developer console in your browser, you will see that the function returns `undefined` because you have not provided it with any return value.\n\nOkay, now that we have some basic understanding of how functions operate, let's look at how they create new \"scopes\" in your code.\n\n## Scope\n\nWhen you create a function, it designates a new __scope__. Scope is the context in which a particular variable is accessible. In other words, it means where a variable can be available for use (read, manipulated, displayed, etc.) in your code. Depending on how and where you declare your variables, you can have different scopes. To understand scope, let's discuss the different ways to declare variables in JavaScript.\n\n### Rethinking Variable Declarations: `var` vs. `let` and `const`\n\nSo far in this course, we have used the `var` keyword to declare variables. While this was the old standard way of declaring variables in JavaScript, in most modern usages it has been replaced by the `let` and `const` keywords. `const` in particular has become the new standard for declaring variables in JavaScript. While you can see that the syntax is the same...\n\n```JavaScript\nvar name = 'John';\nlet age = 30;\nconst isAdmin = true;\n```\n\n...the behavior of the keywords is different. From now on, __we will shift to using the `let` and `const` keywords in this course, and in particular, to using `const`.__ What, then, are the differences between these variable declarations?\n\nTo understand the differences between these declarations, we need to understand their scope. Let's understand the scope of each of these types and see why `let` and especially `const` are the new standard.\n\n### `var`\n\n`var` declarations can be \"globally\" and \"function/locally\" scoped. Global scope means that the variable is available for use anywhere throughout your code. Function scope means that the variable is available for use only within the function it is defined. When declared outside of a function, `var` is global and can be accessed anywhere in your code. When declared inside of a function, `var` is function-scoped and can only be accessed within the function. Take a look at the example below:\n\n```JavaScript\nvar greet = \"hi there\";\n\nfunction newFunction() {\n    var hello = \"hello\";\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, `greet` is globally scoped because it exists outside of the function, while `hello` is function scoped. These variables have different scopes or levels of access. To see what I mean, try running the code below in the editor:\n\n```JavaScript\nvar greet = \"hey hi\"\n\nfunction newFunction() {\n    var hello = \"hello\";\n}\n\nconsole.log(greet); // this would work\nconsole.log(hello); // but this will not\n```\n\n<CodeEditor language='JavaScript'>\n    </CodeEditor>\n\nAs you can see, the console trips up at the `console.log(hello);` and throws a `ReferenceError`, which states that '`hello is not defined`. This is because `hello` is only available inside of the function in which it was declared. If you try to access `hello` outside of the function, JavaScript can't find the variable declaration you are referring to.\n    \nYou have also seen how `var` declarations are mutable, insofar as they can be re-declared and reassigned. You can change the value of a `var` at any time:\n\n```JavaScript\n// re-declaration\nvar greet = \"hi there\";\nvar greet = \"hello there\";\n\n// reassignment\nvar greet = \"hi there\";\ngreet = \"hello there\";\n```\n\nWhile this can be useful in some circumstances, it is not recommended. Once your programs become more complex, you may find yourself accidentally re-declaring or reassigning variables without realizing it. This can cause unexpected behavior and can be a source of bugs. This is a large part of why we will use the `let` and `const` keywords in the future instead of `var`, so let's discuss each of those keywords next.\n\n## `let`\n\nIn contrast to `var`, `let` declarations are block-scoped. This means that the variable is only available within the block of code in which it is declared. As you have seen, a block is a section of code surrounded by curly braces. So, a variable declared inside of a block with `let` is only available within that block. Try running the code below in the editor:\n\n```JavaScript\nlet someValue = 1;\n\nif (someValue > 0) {\n    let greet = \"hi there\";\n    console.log(greet); // this will successfully log \"hi there\"\n}\n\nconsole.log(someValue); // this will successfully log 1\nconsole.log(greet); // but this throws a ReferenceError\n```\n\n<CodeEditor language='JavaScript'>\n    </CodeEditor>\n\nWe can see that using `greet` outside of its block (the curly braces where it was defined) returns an error. Again, this is because `greet` is only available inside of the block in which it was declared. __Note:__ If you cannot see the two successful console logs, check the developer console in your browser, rather than in the embedded code editor.\n\nJust like with `var`, you can reassign the values of `let` variables at any time. However, unlike `var`, you cannot re-declare a `let` variable. So while this will work:\n\n```JavaScript\n// reassignment\nlet greet = \"hi there\";\ngreet = \"hello there\";\n```\n\nThis will not:\n\n```JavaScript\n// re-declaration, will error\nlet greet = \"hi there\";\nlet greet = \"hello there\";\n```\n\nIf you try running the re-declaration code you will get a `SyntaxError` that says `\"Identifier 'greet' has already been declared\"`. Using `let` therefore solves the problem of accidentally re-declaring variables. \n\n__Note:__ While you cannot re-declare a `let` variable within the block is which it was declared, you _can_ re-declare a `let` variable _outside_ of the block in which it was declared:\n\n```JavaScript\nlet greet = \"hi there\";\nif (true) {\n    let greet = \"hello there\";\n    console.log(greet); // this will successfully log \"hello there\"\n}\nconsole.log(greet); // will successfully log \"hi there\"\n```\n\nDo you understand why this works? Because they are block-scoped, both `greet` variables are treated as _entirely different_ variables!\n\nAs you can see, `let` is an improvement over `var` in the sense that it can help you avoid accidentally modifying the value of a variable that you did not intend to modify. However, `const` has become the standard for many cases, so let's look at why.\n\n## `const`\n\nIn the rest of this course, we will often use `const` to declare variables. Like `let`, `const` is block-scoped. This means that the variable is only available within the block of code in which it is declared. However, unlike `let`, `const` variables are __immutable__. This means that once they are declared, they cannot be updated or re-declared. As you might have guessed, `const` is shorthand for \"constant.\" In other words, `const` is a way to declare variables that you will never want to modify.\n\nThe value of a `const` variable always remains the same within its scope. So, if we declare a `const` variable, we can't do any of the following:\n\n```JavaScript\n// reassignment\nconst greet = \"hi there\";\ngreet = \"wait, say hello there instead\"; // throws a TypeError\n\n// re-declaration\nconst greet = \"hi there\";\nconst greet = \"I really wish I could say hello there\"; // throws a TypeError\n```\n\nRunning this code would give you a `TypeError` saying `\"Cannot assign to constant variable\"`. This is because we are trying to change the value of a constant variable.\n\nOkay, now that we have a basic understanding of how scope in JavaScript works, let's move on to utilizing functions to create a simple grading program.\n\n## The Student Grades Program\n\nUsing functions, let's create a simple program that will allow us to evaluate student grades.\n\nLet's imagine that students have just submitted a homework assignment and we need to evaluate their grades. We want to:\n1. Easily display their grades.\n2. A new student has joined and submitted work, so we want to add a student to our list of students.\n3. Evaluate their numbered grade to a letter (A, B, C, D, or F).\n\nFunctions are perfect for this because we can define each of these three tasks as a separate function. We can then call each of these functions at the appropriate time. Remember, functions should be used to perform a single task.\n\nTo begin, let's create an array of students with their corresponding grades:\n\n```JavaScript\nlet students = [['Bob', '55'], ['Alice', '98'], ['Juan', '77'], ['Samar', '100']];\n```\n\nThis array contains four students. Each element (student) is itself an array with two elements. The first element is the student's name and the second element is the student's grade. This is called a __multi-dimensional array__, or an array of arrays. They are useful when we want to store multiple pieces of information about each element of an array.\n\nNow that we have some student data, let's create a function that will allow us to display the students' names and their grades. Because we want to display each student's name and their corresponding grade, we will need to use a `for` loop to iterate over the students array. So, let's create a new `printAllGrades` function that will do just that:\n\n```JavaScript\nlet students = [['Bob', '55'], ['Alice', '98'], ['Juan', '77'], ['Samar', '100']];\n\nfunction printAllGrades(students) {\n    for (let i = 0; i < students.length; i++) {\n        console.log(students[i][0] + ': ' + students[i][1]);\n    }\n}\n\nprintAllGrades(students);\n```\nTry running this code in the editor below, and check the developer console in your browser to see the output.\n\n<CodeEditor language='JavaScript'>\n     </CodeEditor>\n\nIn the developer console you should see each of the students' names and their corresponding grades. Let's break down the `for` loop in the function to see how this works. First, we declare a variable `i` that will be used to iterate over the students array. We will initialize `i` to 0, and then increment `i` by 1 each time the loop runs. Next, we need to check if `i` is less than the length of the students array. If it is, we will continue to run the loop. Inside the loop, we use the variable `i` to access the current element of the students array. Notice the first part of the `console.log()` statement and the difference between the two `students` statements. In the first, we are using `students[i][0]` index to access the student's name. As `[i]` increments, we will iterate through each of the items of the array. Because we have fixed the second element as `[0]`, it will always display the first element of each item (namely, the student's name). In the second, we are using `students[i][1]` to access the student's grade. Again, it will iterate through each of the items of the array. However, this time we are using index `[i][1]` to access the second element of each item (grade). See below to help you understand the reference of each index in the array:\n\n    students[0][0] = 'Bob'; // name of student 0\n    students[0][1] = '55';  // grade of student 0\n\n    students[1][0] = 'Alice'; // name of student 1\n    students[1][1] = '98';  // grade of student 1\n\n    students[2][0] = 'Juan'; // name of student 2\n    students[2][1] = '77'; // grade of student 2\n\n    students[3][0] = 'Samar'; // name of student 3\n    students[3][1] = '100'; // grade of student 3\n\nSimply by iterating through each index of the array we are able to concurrently display the first and second elements of each item.\n\nOkay, so far so good. Now, let's add a new student to our list of students. Do you remember how to add a new element to an array? Take a look at this function:\n\n```JavaScript\nfunction addStudent(students, name, grade) {\n    students.push([name, grade]);\n}\n\naddStudent(students, 'Biff', '32');\n```\n\nAs you might recall, we can use `push` to add a new item. In this code we have created a new function that takes three arguments. The first argument is the `students` array that we want to add to, the second argument is the name of the new student, and the third argument is the grade of the new student. We provide each of these arguments to the function when we call it (poor Biff didn't do too well, sadly).\n\nLet's put it together with the rest of the program, and display our updated students list. Try running the code in the editor:\n\n```JavaScript\nlet students = [['Bob', '55'], ['Alice', '98'], ['Juan', '77'], ['Samar', '100']];\n\nfunction printAllGrades(students) {\n    for (let i = 0; i < students.length; i++) {\n        console.log(students[i][0] + ': ' + students[i][1]);\n    }\n}\n\nfunction addStudent(students, name, grade) {\n    students.push([name, grade]);\n}\n\naddStudent(students, 'Biff', '32');\nprintAllGrades(students);\n```\n\n<CodeEditor language='JavaScript'>\n     </CodeEditor>\n\nYou should now see the new student's name and grade.\n\nIt might be helpful if we could search for a student by name and display their grade. Let's create a new function that will do just that:\n\n```JavaScript\nfunction findStudentGrade(students, name) {\n    for (let i = 0; i < students.length; i++) {\n        if (students[i][0] === name) {\n            return students[i][1];\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nconsole.log(findStudentGrade(students, 'Alice'));\n```\n\nAgain, here we are using the `for` loop to iterate over the students array. We are also using the `if` statement to check if the current element of the students array matches the name we are searching for. If it does, we will return the grade of the student. As parameters we simply pass in the `students` array and the name of the student we are searching for.\n\nLastly, let's create a new function `toLetterGrade()` that will evaluate a student's grade and return a letter grade. For this function, we could also utilize our `findStudentGrade()` function so that we can search for a student and convert their grade, like so:\n\n```JavaScript\nfunction toLetterGrade(students, name) {\n    const grade = findStudentGrade(students, name);\n    if (grade >= 90) {\n        return 'A';\n    } else if (grade >= 80) {\n        return 'B';\n    } else if (grade >= 70) {\n        return 'C';\n    } else if (grade >= 60) {\n        return 'D';\n    } else {\n        return 'F';\n    }\n}\n\nconsole.log(toLetterGrade(students, 'Alice'));\n```\n\nAs you can see, we create a new constant variable `grade` and assign it the value of the grade of the student we are searching for by capturing the result of our `findStudentGrade()` function. Keep in mind that it can be very useful to store the result of a function in a variable, even within a different function! We then use a series of `if/else` statements to determine the letter grade of the student and return it.\n\nLet's put the whole program together and run it:\n\n```JavaScript\nlet students = [['Bob', '55'], ['Alice', '98'], ['Juan', '77'], ['Samar', '100']];\n\nfunction printAllGrades(students) {\n    for (let i = 0; i < students.length; i++) {\n        console.log(students[i][0] + ': ' + students[i][1]);\n    }\n}\n\nfunction addStudent(students, name, grade) {\n    students.push([name, grade]);\n}\n\nfunction findStudentGrade(students, name) {\n    for (let i = 0; i < students.length; i++) {\n        if (students[i][0] === name) {\n            return students[i][1];\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nfunction toLetterGrade(students, name) {\n    const grade = findStudentGrade(students, name);\n    if (grade >= 90) {\n        return 'A';\n    } else if (grade >= 80) {\n        return 'B';\n    } else if (grade >= 70) {\n        return 'C';\n    } else if (grade >= 60) {\n        return 'D';\n    } else {\n        return 'F';\n    }\n}\n\naddStudent(students, 'Biff', '32');\nprintAllGrades(students);\nconsole.log(findStudentGrade(students, 'Alice'));\nconsole.log(toLetterGrade(students, 'Alice'));\n```\n\nTry running the program below in the editor and seeing the result in the developer console.\n\n<CodeEditor language='JavaScript'>\n     </CodeEditor>\n\nCongratulations, you have now created a simple grading program utilizing functions!\n\nFunctions are a great way to keep your code organized and readable. They can also be used to create reusable pieces of code that can be employed in multiple places in your program. Remember that functions should ideally always be used to perform a single task, and that their names should be descriptive of the task they are performing.\n\n## Review Questions\n\nLet's review the concepts we have learned in this lesson.\n\n1. What is the naming convention for functions in JavaScript?\n\n<Quiz>\n- lowercase_with_underscores\n- lower camelCase*\n- snake_case\n- PascalCase\n</Quiz>\n\n2. What will be the result of the following code?\n\n```JavaScript\nlet someValue = 1;\n\nif (someValue > 0) {\n    let greet = \"hi there\";\n    console.log(greet);\n}\n\nconsole.log(greet);\n```\n\n<Quiz>\n- hi there\n- undefined\n- ReferenceError*\n- TypeError\n</Quiz>\n\n3. Should you use the `var` keyword to declare a variable?\n\n<Quiz>\n- Yes\n- No*\n- Don't tell me what to do!\n</Quiz>\n\n## Challenges\n\n1. Write a function that always returns the last item in whatever array is passed to it. (Hint: Refer to the [Loops and Arrays](http://localhost:3000/workshop/Javascript/?page=5) lesson if you need a refresher on an easy way to do this.)\n\n2. Biff decided to drop your class after his unfortunate grade. Add a function to the Student Grades program that will remove Biff from the list of students.\n\n3. At the moment, our `toLetterGrade()` function requires the user to manually type the name of each student in order to convert their grade. Write a new function that will iterate through the entire list of students and convert their grades to letter grades.\n\n## Key Terms\n\nDo you recall the meaning of the following terms?\n\n- parameter/argument\n- pass (values)\n- call (function)\n- return value\n- constant\n- multidimensional array\n- scope\n\n# VSCode and GitHub\n\nUp to this point we have been working entirely in the browser and our work has faded into the past at every screen refresh. Ephemerality is not a feature much appreciated in programming. So, to get started on something more permanent, let's set up a practice folder to hold our code. Call it `javascript`, or whatever you want, as long as you promise to remember it. Throughout the rest of this course, we will be working in this folder.\n\nClick this button to download a couple of files we'll be needing. Add them to your working folder.\n\n<Download files='index.html, script.js'><br />\n\nNext, we'll want to get our coding environment set up. This will be the main focus of this particular lesson. We'll first install the VSCode code editor, and then learn how to set up and use a GitHub repository.\n\nMuch of your academic career has likely been structured around sending in single documents. For instance, a .pdf or Word document of your latest essay masterpiece. In general, however, going forward in this class you'll want to think of your work in terms of a __project__, which is a collection of files and code that you want to work on. In the coding environment we'll set up and project we'll create, we'll be working with many files that will all contribute to the same project. A website, for instance, is a project, made up of many different files. What we will end up building by the end of this course will all be housed in the same folder and will be managed though a single GitHub repository. This will hopefully make more sense once we get into it.\n\nFor now, let's go ahead and install VSCode.\n\n## VSCode\n\nVSCode is a free and open-source code editor that is available for Windows, Mac, and Linux. It is a great tool for developers to use when they are working on code. It supports syntax highlighting, code completion, has built-in GitHub integration, and has an extensive library of extensions that can be used to extend its functionality.\n\n### Installing VSCode\n\nNavigate to the [homepage of VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and download the appropriate version for your operating system (stable version).\n\n![VSCode homepage](/images/vscode_homepage.png)\n\nOnce it is installed, open up the application. On the left sidebar, you'll see a few different options. Let's look at three of them:\n\n![VSCode sidebar](/images/vs_code_sidebar.png)\n\n- The Explorer Window is the main window that you'll be working with. It is the main way to navigate through your project and to interact with files.\n- The Search Window is a window that you can use to search for files or words throughout your project.\n- The Source Control Window will allow you to manage your project's files and code through GitHub integration.\n\nThese are the main windows you'll be working with, along with the main code editor area, in which you'll be writing code.\n\n### Opening a Project\n\nFor now, go ahead and open up the Explorer Window and click Open Folder. Navigate to your working folder for the course, select the folder, and click Select Folder.\n\nIn the Explorer, you should now be able to view both the `index.html` file and the `script.js` file, and can open them to view the code for each file.\n\n![New Project](/images/vscode_openproject.png)\n\nNext, let's go ahead and initialize a git repository for our project.\n\n## Creating a GitHub Account\n\nThe first step we'll need to take is to set up a GitHub account. Navigate to the [GitHub homepage](https://github.com/) and click Sign Up for GitHub. You'll be prompted to create a new account.\n\n![GitHub Sign Up](/images/github_homepage.png)\n\nWork through the steps to create a new account and return here when you are done.\n\n## Getting Acquainted with Git and GitHub\n\nNow that you have a GitHub account, let's go ahead and initialize a repository (folder) for our project. \n\nFirst, we should understand a little about how Git and Github work. __Git__ is a version control system that allows you to track changes to your files. If you have used \"track changes\" in the past with either Microsoft Word or Google Docs, you're likely familiar with the terminology.\n\nGitHub is an online platform for hosting Git repositories. It functions for some, predominantly programmers, as a social network for sharing and collaborating on code-based projects. Users can share their own projects, as well as search for others, which they can then often work on and contribute to. Digital Humanists, librarians, and other academics are also finding ways Git and GitHub are useful in writing projects and teaching.\n\nA [study of how Digital Humanists use GitHub](https://digitalscholarship.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/spirosmithdh2016githubpresentationfinal.pdf), conducted by Lisa Spiro and Sean Morey Smith, found that a wide range of users, including professors, research staff, graduate students, IT staff, and librarians commonly used the site in their DH work. They used GitHub for a diverse range of activities, such as:\n\n- Developing software\n- Sharing data sets\n- Creating websites\n- Writing articles and books\n- Collating online resources\n- Keeping research notes\n- Hosting syllabi and course materials\n\nNevertheless, using Git and GitHub effectively takes a bit of practice. It is notorious for being a bit of a pain in the neck (leading to such websites as [Oh Shit, Git!](https://ohshitgit.com/)), but it is worth it.\n\n## Initializing a Git Repository on GitHub\n\nGit can be enabled in a folder, and then used to save the state of the contents in that folder at different points in the future. It will also keep a record of all changes made in the past. It knows exactly when a file is added to a project and even when it is deleted. It can even resurrect files that have been deleted, if needed.\n\nLet's go ahead and initialize a git repository for our project. In VSCode, click on the Source Control Window and click on the `Initialize Repository` button.\n\n![Initialize Repository](/images/vscode_initgit.png)\n\nYou should now be able to see the following:\n\n![Initial Commit](/images/vscode_gitcommit.png)\n\nIn Git, every change you make to a file and submit to the repository is called a __commit__. A commit is effectively a snapshot of the file at a certain point in time. Every commit also has a __commit message__, which is a short description of what the commit is all about, either for yourself or for others you are collaborating with.\n\nLet's go ahead and make our first commit. In VSCode, type \"first commit\" in the message window and click `Commit`.\n\nYou should receive a message that `There are no staged changes to commit`. \n\n![No Staged Changes](/images/vscode_nostaged.png)\n\nThis is because we haven't made any changes to any files yet and because we haven't __staged__ any files yet. Before making a commit, you need to add the files to the staging environment. Staged files are those that are ready to be committed. This will make more sense later as we continue to work with Git.\n\nFor now, go ahead and click `Yes` to the prompt.\n\nAfterwards, you should see a button updated to `Publish Branch`.\n\n![Publish Branch](/images/vscode_publishbranch.png)\n\nGo ahead and click Publish Branch. You should be prompted to sign into GitHub. Go ahead and click `Allow`, and sign in to GitHub with your account.\n\nIf you receive a message to `Authorize VSCode`, click Authorize.\n\n![Authorize VSCode](/images/github_authorize.png)\n\nIf you are given additional messages to allow VSCode to access your account, click through to allow.\n\nLastly, you will want to give your repository a name. In VSCode at the top, you should say a text field window for typing the name of your repository. Give it whatever name you want, and click `Publish to public repository`.\n\nAfterwards, you should see a message that says `Successfully published to GitHub` in the lower right corner of VSCode. (If you also receive a message to `periodically run got fetch`, you can just say no for now.)\n\n![Successfully Published](/images/github_published.png)\n\nIf you click through to `Open in GitHub`, you should be able to see the repository you just created, along with a message of your first commit.\n\n![New Repository](/images/github_new_repository.png)\n\nCongratulations! You have successfully created a new GitHub repository for this course.\n\nLet's go ahead and explore our files a bit, make a new change, and make a new commit to our repository.\n\n## Exploring our Files\n\nBack in VSCode, open up the Explorer Window and click on the `index.html` file. \n\n![index.html](/images/index_scrn.png)\n\nThis is an HTML file. It contains the code for the page that we will be working with. We will learn more about HTML in the next lesson.\n\nNow open the `script.js` file. As you can tell by the file extension (`.js`), this is a JavaScript file. It contains the code for the JavaScript that we will be working with.\n\nAs a project, each of these files is contributing to the webpage. We will learn more about how later, but for now let's look at the webpage in your browser.\n\nNavigate to your folder containing these two files (in your file system, not in VSCode), and double-click the `index.html` file to open it in your browser.\n\nYou should see the following:\n\n![Hey it worked!](/images/heyitworked.png)\n\nIf you reference both files in VSCode, you can see that text from each is being reflected on the webpage. In the HTML file, we are displaying `This is my project!` and `This is the response div`. In the JavaScript file, we are providing an alert that says `Hey it worked!`.\n\n### Making a Change\n\nWithout worrying about the HTML for now, let's change the `Hey it worked!` message to `My project is going to be awesome!`.\n\nIf you save, the file now, you should see a new change being registered in the source control window.\n\n![Second Commit](/images/second_commit.png)\n\nThe number 1 in the source control icon indicates that there is one change to the file. If you click on it, you can see that it is tracking the changes made to the file. The little `M` next to the file name indicates that the file is modified. \n\n### Staging our Change\n\nYou can also see a `+` (plus) sign next to the file name, which allows you to stage a change for commit. Go ahead and click it. You should now see a section that says `Staged Changes`.\n\n![Staged Changes](/images/staged_changes.png)\n\n### Committing our Change\n\nNow that we have staged our change, let's go ahead and commit our change. Be sure to type a message for the commit, like `Second Commit`.\n\n### Pushing our Changes to GitHub\n\nYou should now see a button that says `Sync Changes`. In the lingo of Git, this is called __pushing__ your changes. It is a way to send your changes to the remote repository on GitHub. Simply committing your changes will not make the changes on your remote repository until you push them. Let's go ahead and click `Sync Changes` and click `Ok`to the prompt.\n\nIf you navigate to your repository in GitHub, you should see a new commit with the message `Second Commit`.\n\n![New Commit](/images/github_secondcommit.png)\n\nCongratulations! You have successfully pushed your changes to GitHub.\n\nIn general, the process for working with Git is as follows:\n1. Make Changes\n2. Stage modified files\n3. Commit files with message\n4. Push to remote repository on GitHub\n\n# HTML\n\nUp to this point our work has faded into the past at every screen refresh. Ephemerality is not a feature much appreciated in programming. To get started on something more permanent, let's set up a practice folder to hold our code. Call it `javascript`, or whatever you want, as long as you promise to remember it. Throughout this class, we will be working in this folder.\nClick this button to download a couple of files we'll be needing. Add them to your working folder.\n<Download files='index.html, script.js'>\n\n## The HTML\n\nFirst we need to understand the HTML. HTML is the markup language that is used to create web pages. It is a simple language that is used to describe the structure of a web page. \n    \n```html\n<!doctype HTML>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n  <head>\n    <meta charset=\"utf-8\">\n    <title>My JavaScripting Master's Student Project</title>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <h1>This is my project!</h1>\n    <div id=\"response\">This is the #response div.</div>\n    <script src=\"https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.2.1.min.js\"></script>\n    <script src=\"scripts.js\"></script>\n  </body>\n</html>\n```\n\n## The JavaScript\n\n```javascript\nalert('Hey, it worked!');\n```\n\n<JSConsole />\n\n\n\nLoops are a way to repeat a block of code a certain number of times. Deciding when and how often to repeat a block of code is a huge part of what makes programming useful. One key concept of looping is 'iteration'. Iteration is moving through a series of items, one at a time. Here is an example of a loop iterating through a list of numbers:\n\n```javascript\nvar numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\nfor (var i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {\n    console.log(numbers[i]);\n}\n```\n\nNotice that we set a variable called `i` to 0. This is called the 'initialization' of the loop. We then set the condition that the loop will run as long as `i` is less than the length of the array. This is called the 'test'. We then increment `i` by 1. This is called the 'update'. We use that index to get the value at that index in the array. So, in order, we initialize, test, and update.\n\nLet's talk through the loop we made. First, we initialize the loop. We set `i` to 0. Then, we test the condition. We check to see if `i` is less than the length of the array. If it is, we move on to the next step. If it isn't, we exit the loop. Then, we update the loop. We increment `i` by 1. We repeat the loop until `i` is greater than or equal to the length of the array. Inside the loop, we use the index `i` to get the value at that index in the array. So, we get the value at index 0, then the value at index 1, then the value at index 2, etc.\n\nLet's add a loop to our index.html file. We'll use the same code as before, but this time we'll add a button to the page that will run the loop.\n\n## The HTML\n\n```html\n<!doctype HTML>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n    <head>\n        <meta charset=\"utf-8\">\n        <title>My JavaScripting Master's Student Project</title>\n        <script src=\"https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.2.1.min.js\"></script>\n        <script src=\"scripts.js\"></script>\n    </head>\n    <body>\n        <h1>This is my project!</h1>\n        <div id=\"response\">This is the #response div.</div>\n        <button id=\"button\">Click me!</button>\n    </body>\n</html>\n```\n\n## The JavaScript\n\n```javascript\nvar numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\n$('#button').click(function() {\n    for (var i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {\n        console.log(numbers[i]);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nSee how we're connecting the button to the loop? We're using the `$` function to select the element with the id `button`. We're also using the `click` function to run the loop when the button is clicked.\n\n# Functions\n\nFunctions are a way to group code together. They are useful for keeping your code organized. They are also a great way to reuse code. Here's an example:\n\n```javascript\nfunction add(a, b) {\n    return a + b;\n}\n```\n\nThis function is called `add`. It takes two parameters, `a` and `b`. It then returns the sum of `a` and `b`. What does it mean to `return` something? Let's take a look:\n\n```javascript\nvar newValue = add(1, 2);\nconsole.log(newValue);\n```\n\nWhat does `newValue` equal? It equals 3. This is because we called the function `add` with the parameters 1 and 2, which returned 3. So, returning something is a way to get the value of something, just like getting the end result of a calculation.\n\nSo, you could call this function a machine that adds two numbers. Let's talk about the syntax:\n\n```javascript\n    `function name(parameter1, parameter2) {`\n    `    code to run`\n    `}`\n``` \n\nInside the parentheses, we're defining the parameters. This is just like defining variables, but they're used to pass values into the function. Let's try it out.\n\n```javascript\nvar firstNumber = 1;\nvar secondNumber = 2;\nvar c = add(firstNumber, secondNumber);\nconsole.log(c);\n```\n\nThis is something that all learning programmers have to wrap their head around. INSIDE the function, `firstNumber` and `secondNumber` are known as `a` and `b`. We're calling the function `add` and passing `a` and `b` into it. The function then returns the sum of `a` and `b`. This move is confusing at first, but is key to understanding how functions work. Let's try another one.\n\n```javascript\nfunction howFeel(mood) {\n    if (mood === 'happy') {\n        return 'I feel happy!';\n    } else if (mood === 'sad') {\n        return 'I feel sad!';\n    } else {\n        return 'I feel neutral!';\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNotice that we've included an if/else statement. Everything we've learned up to this point can be used in a function. Here's another one, this time looping through a list:\n\n```javascript\nvar NYBoroughs = ['Manhattan', 'Bronx', 'Brooklyn', 'Queens', 'Staten Island'];\nfor (var i = 0; i < NYBoroughs.length; i++) {\n    if (NYBoroughs[i] === 'Queens') {\n        console.log('Queens has the best food!');\n    } else {\n        console.log(NYBoroughs[i]);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n<JSTerminal />\n\n<CodeEditor language='javascript'>\nvar t = 10;\n</CodeEditor>\n\n# Errors in JavaScript\n\nWhen encountering an error, the browser will stop running the code. It will show an error message. The error will show a few things:\n\n- The line of code that caused the error\n- The error message\n- The stack trace\n\nThere are a few main types of errors:\n\n- Syntax errors\n- Runtime errors\n- Logical errors\n\nSyntax errors are when the code is not written correctly. Runtime errors are when the code is written correctly, but the computer is not able to run it. Logical errors are when the code is written correctly, but the computer is not able to run it because it is not doing what it should.\n\nWhen you have a syntax error, the error report will show you the line of code that caused the error. It is not always clear where the error is. It is often the line of code that comes after the error (??). There are online resources that can help you find the error, such as [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/). Stack Overflow is a great place to find answers to your questions. The people there are not always friendly.\n\nIf you get a runtime error, the error report will show you the line of code that caused the error. It will also show you the error message. The error message is often a little more specific than the line of code. It will also show you the stack trace. The stack trace is a list of the lines of code that were run before the error. It is often helpful to look at the stack trace to see where the error is.\n\nIf you get a logical error, the error report will show you the line of code that caused the error. It will also show you the error message. The error message is often a little more specific than the line of code. It will also show you the stack trace. The stack trace is a list of the lines of code that were run before the error. It is often helpful to look at the stack trace to see where the error is.\n\n# HTML & CSS\n\nYou've got to have a webpage with content in it in order to use JavaScript to manipulate it! We're going to use css Grid and Flexbox to get where we're going, so nothing like Bootstrap or etc.\n\n# Input\n\nWe're gonna add some INTERACTIVITY to our project. We're going to add a button to the page that will ask the user for their name. We're going to add a div to the page that will show the user their name. \n\n```html\n<!doctype HTML>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n    <head>\n        <meta charset=\"utf-8\">\n        <title>My JavaScripting Master's Student Project</title>\n        <script src=\"https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.2.1.min.js\"></script>\n        <script src=\"scripts.js\"></script>\n    </head>\n    <body>\n        <h1>This is my project!</h1>\n        <div id=\"response\">This is the #response div.</div>\n        <button id=\"button\">Click me!</button>\n    </body>\n</html>\n```\n## The JavaScript\n\n```javascript\n$('#button').click(function() {\n    var name = prompt('What is your name?');\n    $('#response').text(name);\n}\n```\n\n# Finding Answers with Google\n\nThe absolute most important thing to learn is how to find answers to your questions. This means learning how to ask the right questions. It comes through practice. Seeing an error\n\n# Objects in JavaScript\n\nObjects are a way to store data in a structured way. They are useful for storing data that has a lot of different properties. Here's an example:\n\n```javascript\n    var person = {\n        name: 'Sandra',\n        age: 30,\n        favoriteFood: 'pizza'\n    };\n```\n\nWhat's nice about this is that we can access the properties of the object using dot notation. What is the difference between dot notation and bracket notation? Let's take a look:\n```javascript\n    person.name;\n    person['name'];\n```\n\n# Documentation and How to Interpret It\n\nDocumentation exists to explain what a tool is and how to use it. Too often, whether because documentation is an afterthought, or because the people responsible for making it are better programmers than communicators, technical documentation fails to make itself clear. Paradoxically, it is often necessary to already be familiar with using a tool in order to interpret the instructions about how to use it.\n\n# Leaflet\n\nD3 is a JavaScript library that allows you to create visualizations. Other tools are higher-level libraries that have more assumptions about how to use them. D3 is less opinionated about how to use it. It is more flexible. It is more robust. It is more efficient. It is more powerful. BUT it is more complicated. Here's a quick example of how to use D3:\n\n<HTMLEditor >\n\n<html>\n <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://unpkg.com/leaflet@1.8.0/dist/leaflet.css\"/>\n <script src=\"https://unpkg.com/leaflet@1.8.0/dist/leaflet.js\"></script>\n    <div id=\"map\"></div>\n</html>\n<css>\n#map {\n    height: 400px;\n    width: 400px;\n}\n</css>\n<javascript>\n```\nvar map = L.map('map').setView([51.505, -0.09], 13);\nL.tileLayer('https://{s}.tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png', {\n\tmaxZoom: 19,\n\tattribution: '&copy; <a href=\"https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright\">OpenStreetMap</a> contributors'\n}).addTo(map);\nL.marker([51.5, -0.09]).addTo(map)\n    .bindPopup('A pretty CSS3 popup.<br> Easily customizable.')\n    .openPopup();\n```\n</javascript>\n\n</HTMLEditor>\n\n# Clicking Stuff\n\nLet's make it so that when you click on something, something happens. \n\n# Planning a Project\n\nNow we design the final project, drawing it out when necessary.\n\n# Lab\nasd\n\n# Lab","title":"Intro to Javascript","excerpt":"This is a basic introduction to JavaScript, which is the programming language of the web.
