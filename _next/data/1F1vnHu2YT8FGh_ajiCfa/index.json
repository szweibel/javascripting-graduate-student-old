It was used primarily for desktop applications, but as the web became a bigger deal, Java was positioned as the language of choice for web development.\n\n- test\n- test2\n\n\n<CodeEditor language='JavaScript'>\n1 + 1\n</CodeEditor>\n\n# Types\n\nJavascript deals in data types, which are the fundamental building blocks of the language. When a variable is declared, it is assigned a type. The five core data types are:\n\n- Numbers\n- Strings\n- Booleans\n- Arrays\n- Objects\n\n## Numbers\n\n- Integers\n- Floats\n\n## Strings\n\n## Booleans\n\n- True\n- False\n\n## Arrays\n\n- Lists\n- Tuples\n\n## Objects\n\n- Dictionaries\n- Classes\n\n# Variables\n\nVariables are like containers for data. They are named and can be assigned a value.\n\n```JavaScript\nvar a = 1;\nvar b = 2;\nvar c = a + b;\n```\n\nNotice in the above example that the variable `c` is assigned the value of `a + b`. Now let's make something ever so slightly more interesting. Let's talk about the weather.\n\n```JavaScript\nvar weather = 'sunny';\nvar statement = 'The weather is ' + weather + ' today.';\n```\n\nWe can use the `+` operator to combine strings and variables. This is called concatenation.\n\n\n# Let's make a Thing\n\nUsing 'if' statements, we can make decisions based on the value of a variable.\n\nHere's a simple example:\n\n```JavaScript\nif ( true ) {\n    console.log('It is true!');\n}\n```\nSo the thing inside the `if` statement is evaluated. If it is true, the code inside the `{}` block is executed.\n\n<Download files='index.html, script.js'>\n\n```JavaScript\nvar a = 1;\nif (a == 1) {\n    console.log('a is 1');\n}\n```\n\n```JavaScript\nvar weather = 'cold';\nif (weather === 'sunny') {\n    console.log('It is a beautiful day!');\n} else {\n    console.log('It is not a beautiful day.');\n}\n```\n'console.log' is a function that prints a message to the console.\n\n\n<JSConsole />\n\n# Functions\nThis is a function. a function is a block of code that can be called to perform a specific task. The function is defined with the keyword function. The function is followed by the name of the function and parentheses. The parentheses contain the parameters of the function. The parameters are separated by commas. The code block that contains the function is indented.\n\n\n<JSTerminal />\n\n# Errors in JavaScript\n\n# Lists\n\n# Loops\n\n\n# Input\n\n# Doing Things to Lists\n\n# Finding Answers with Google\n\n# Objects in JavaScript\n","title":"Intro to Javascript","excerpt":"This is a basic introduction to JavaScript, which is the programming language of the web. The class is designed for anyone interested in developing a website, or creating an interactive data visualization. By the end of this course, you will be able to read JavaScript you find online, and adapt it to your needs. You will have an opportunity to work with common JavaScript libraries/tools.","cover_image":"/images/workshop/img2.jpg","readings":["Want to learn programming, but not convinced that the Python language is the right language?
